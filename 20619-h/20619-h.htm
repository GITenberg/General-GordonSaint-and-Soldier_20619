<p>Nothing but the greatest possible pressure from my many kind 
friends who have heard my lecture on &ldquo;General Gordon: Saint
and Soldier,&rdquo; who knew of my intimacy with him, and had 
seen some of the letters referred to, would have induced me to 
narrate this little story of a noble life.&nbsp; I am greatly 
indebted to many friends, authors, and newspapers, for extracts 
and incidents, etc., etc.; and to them I beg to offer my best 
thanks and humble apology.&nbsp; This book is issued in the hope,
that, with all its imperfections, it may inspire the young men of
our times to imitate the Christ-like spirit and example of our 
illustrious and noble hero, C. G. Gordon.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is nothing purer than honesty; 
nothing sweeter than charity; nothing warmer than love; nothing 
richer than wisdom; nothing brighter than virtue; nothing more 
steadfast than faith.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bacon</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been said that the most interesting study for mankind 
is man; and surely one of the grandest objects for human 
contemplation, is a noble character; a lofty type of a truly 
great and good man is humanity&rsquo;s richest heritage.</p>
<p>The following lines by one of our greatest poets are 
true&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lives of great men all remind us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We can make our lives sublime,<br />
And departing leave behind us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Footprints on the sands of time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While places and things may have a special or peculiar charm, 
and indeed may become very interesting, nothing stirs our hearts,
or rouses our enthusiasm so much as the study of a noble heroic 
life, such as that of the uncrowned king, <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>who is the 
subject of our story, and whose career of unsullied splendour 
closed in the year 1885 in the beleaguered capital of that dark 
sad land, where the White and Blue Nile blend their waters.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Noble he was contemning all things mean,<br
/>
His truth unquestioned and his soul severe,<br />
At no man&rsquo;s question was he e&rsquo;er dismayed,<br />
Of no man&rsquo;s presence was he e&rsquo;er afraid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Gordon was the son of a soldier who proved his 
gallantry on many occasions, and who took a pride in his 
profession.&nbsp; It was said of him that he was greatly beloved 
by all who served under him.&nbsp; He was generous, genial and 
kind hearted, and strictly just in all his practices and 
aims.&nbsp; He gave to his Queen and country a long life of 
devoted service.&nbsp; His wife, we are told, was a woman of 
marked liberality; cheerful and loving, always thoughtful of the 
wants of others; completely devoid of selfishness.</p>
<p>The fourth son, and third soldier of this happy pair, Charles 
George, was born at Woolwich in 1833.&nbsp; He was trained at 
Taunton.&nbsp; When about 15 years of age he was <!-- page 
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>sent 
to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, to prepare for the 
army; a profession his father thought most worthy of the 
Gordons.&nbsp; While here at school an incident occurred which 
served to show that our young hero was no ordinary student.&nbsp;
His tutor, with an air of contempt, rebuked him severely for some
error or failure in his lessons, and told him sneeringly he would
never make a general.&nbsp; This roused the Scotch blood of the 
budding soldier, and in a rage he tore the epaulettes from his 
shoulders, and threw them at his tutor&rsquo;s feet&mdash;another
proof of the correctness of the old adage, &ldquo;Never prophesy 
unless you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the time he reached the age of 
twenty-one, he had become every inch a soldier, and when tested 
he proved to have all a soldier&rsquo;s qualities&mdash;bravery, 
courage, heroism, patriotism, and fidelity, characteristics of 
the best soldiers in our army.</p>
<p>Archibald Forbes, writing of him, says &ldquo;The character of
General Gordon was unique.&nbsp; As it unfolded in its curiously 
varied but never contradictory aspects, you are reminded of 
Cromwell, of Havelock, of Livingstone, and of Captain Hedley 
Viccars.&nbsp; But Gordon&rsquo;s <!-- page 16--><a 
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>individuality
stood out in its incomparable blending of masterfulness and 
tenderness, of strength and sweetness.&nbsp; His high and noble 
nature was made more chivalrous by his fervent, deep and real 
piety.&nbsp; His absolute trust in God guided him serenely 
through the greatest difficulties.&nbsp; Because of that he was 
not alone in the deepest solitude.&nbsp; He was not depressed in 
the direst extremity.&nbsp; He had learned the happy art of 
leaning upon the Omnipotent arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Early in 1884 a leading newspaper said of him, &ldquo;General 
Gordon is without doubt the finest captain of irregular forces 
living.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the same time Mr. Gladstone said of 
him, &ldquo;General Gordon is no common man.&nbsp; It is no 
exaggeration to say he is a hero.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration to 
say he is a Christian hero.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. W. E. Forster also 
remarked of him, &ldquo;I know no other man living for whom I 
have a greater admiration than General Gordon.&nbsp; He is 
utterly unselfish.&nbsp; He is regardless of money.&nbsp; He 
cares nothing for fame or glory.&nbsp; He cares little for life 
or death.&nbsp; He is a deeply religious man.&nbsp; The world to 
come, and God&rsquo;s government over this, are to him the 
greatest of life&rsquo;s realities.&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>True heroism 
has been said to be a sacrifice of self for the benefit of 
others.&nbsp; If this is true, Gordon has well won the 
appellation, &ldquo;The Hero of the Soudan.&rdquo;&nbsp; His 
soldierly qualities were first tested in the Crimea, where we 
find him in 1854 and 1855.&nbsp; Here for the first time in his 
military career he was brought face to face with all the horrors 
of actual war, and here for the first time he saw friend and foe 
lie locked like brothers in each other&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Here 
he got his first baptism of fire; and here he showed the splendid
qualities which in after years made him so famous and so 
beloved.&nbsp; An old soldier who served under him during this 
terrible campaign says &ldquo;I shall never forget that 
remarkable figure and form, which was an inspiration to all who 
knew him, and saw him on the field of carnage and 
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was utterly unconcerned in the midst of dangers and 
death.&nbsp; He would twirl his cane and good humouredly say 
&ldquo;Now boys, don&rsquo;t fear, I see no danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
On one occasion when engaged in the very thick of a most awful 
struggle he said, &ldquo;Now my boys, I&rsquo;m your officer, I 
lead, you follow,&rdquo; and he walked literally through <!-- 
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>a shower of lead and iron with as little concern 
apparently, as if he were walking across his own drawing-room; 
and he came out of the conflict without a scar.</p>
<p>Sir E. Stanton in his dispatches home, making special 
reference to our hero, says&mdash;&ldquo;Young Gordon has 
attracted the notice of his superiors out here, not only by his 
activity, but by his special aptitude for war, developing itself 
amid the trenches before Sebastopol, in a personal knowledge of 
the enemy&rsquo;s movements, such as no officer has 
displayed.&nbsp; We have sent him frequently right up to the 
Russian entrenchments to find out what new moves they are 
making.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amid all the excitement of war and its 
dangers he never omitted writing to his mother; an example I hope
my readers, if boys, or girls, will studiously copy.&nbsp; He 
loved his mother with the passion of his great loving 
heart.&nbsp; Soldier lads often forget their mother&rsquo;s 
influence, their mother&rsquo;s prayers, and their mother&rsquo;s
God.&nbsp; Writing home to his mother he says &ldquo;We are 
giving the Redan shells day and night, in order to prevent the 
Russians from repairing it and they repay us by sending amongst 
us awful <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>missiles of death and destruction, 
and it requires one to be very nimble to keep out of their 
way.&nbsp; I have now been thirty-four times, twenty-four hours 
in the trenches; that is more than a month without any relief 
whatever, and I assure you it gets very tedious.&nbsp; Still one 
does not mind if any advance is being made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An eye witness of this bloody work in the trenches and the 
storming of the Malakof and the Redan, writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On that terrible 8th of September, every 
gun and mortar that our people and our noble allies, the French, 
could bring to bear upon the enemy&rsquo;s work, was raining 
death and destruction upon them.&nbsp; The stormers had all got 
into their places.&nbsp; They consisted of about 1,000 men of the
Old Light and 2nd Division; the supports were formed up as 
closely as possible to them, and all appeared in readiness.&nbsp;
History may well say, &lsquo;the storming of a fortress is an 
awful task.&rsquo;&nbsp; There we stood not a word being spoken; 
every one seemed to be full of thought; many a courageous heart, 
that was destined to be still in death in one short hour, was now
beating high.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>&ldquo;It was about 11.15 a.m., and our heavy guns were 
firing in such a way as I have never heard before.&nbsp; The 
batteries fired in volleys or salvoes as fast as they could load 
and fire, the balls passing a few feet above our heads, while the
air seemed full of shell.&nbsp; The enemy were not idle; for 
round shot, shell, grape and musket balls were bounding and 
whizzing all about us, and earth and stones were rattling about 
our heads like hail.&nbsp; Our poor fellows fell fast, but still 
our sailors and artillery men stuck to it manfully.&nbsp; We knew
well that this could not last long, but many a brave 
soldier&rsquo;s career was cut short long before we advanced to 
the attack&mdash;strange some of our older hands were smoking and
taking not the slightest notice of this &lsquo;dance of 
death.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some men were being carried past dead, and 
others limping to the rear with mangled limbs, while their 
life&rsquo;s blood was streaming fast away.&nbsp; We looked at 
each other with amazement for we were now under a most terrible 
fire.&nbsp; We knew well it meant death to many of us.&nbsp; 
Several who had gone through the whole campaign shook hands 
saying, &lsquo;This is hot,&rsquo; &lsquo;Good bye, old 
boy,&rsquo; &lsquo;Write to the old <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>folks for me 
if I do not return.&rsquo;&nbsp; This request was made by many of
us.&nbsp; I was close to one of our Generals, who stood watch in 
hand, when suddenly at 12 o&rsquo;clock mid-day the French drums 
and bugles sounded the charge, and with a shout, &lsquo;Vive 
l&rsquo;Empereur&rsquo; repeated over and over again by some 
50,000 men, a shout that was enough to strike terror into the 
enemy.&nbsp; The French, headed by the Zouaves, sprang forward at
the Malakof like a lot of cats.&nbsp; On they went like a lot of 
bees, or rather like the dashing of the waves of the sea against 
a rock.&nbsp; We had a splendid view of their operations, it was 
grand but terrible; the deafening shouts of the advancing hosts 
told us they were carrying all before them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were now completely enveloped in smoke and fire, 
but column after column kept advancing, pouring volley after 
volley into the breasts of the defenders.&nbsp; They (the French)
meant to have it, let the cost be what it might.&nbsp; At 12.15 
up went the proud flag of France, with a shout that drowned for a
time the roar of both cannon and musketry.&nbsp; And now came our
turn.&nbsp; As soon as the French were seen upon the <!-- page 
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>Malakof our stormers sprang forward, led by Colonel 
Windham&mdash;the old Light Division consisting of 300 men of the
90th, about the same number of the 97th, and about 400 of the 2nd
Battalion Rifle Brigade, and with various detachments of the 2nd 
and Light Divisions, and a number of blue jackets, carrying 
scaling ladders.&nbsp; Our men advanced splendidly, with a 
ringing British cheer, although the enemy poured a terrible fire 
of grape, canister and musketry into them, which swept down whole
companies at a time.&nbsp; We, the supports, moved forward to 
back up our comrades.&nbsp; We advanced as quickly as we could 
until we came to the foremost trench, when we leaped the parapet,
then made a rush at the blood stained walls of the Redan.&nbsp; 
We had had a clear run of over 200 yards under that murderous 
fire of grape, canister and musketry.&nbsp; How any ever lived to
pass that 200 yards seemed a miracle; for our poor fellows fell 
one on the top of another; but nothing could stop us but 
death.&nbsp; On we went shouting until we reached the 
redoubt.&nbsp; The fighting inside these works was of the most 
desperate character, butt and <!-- page 23--><a 
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>bayonet, foot
and fist; the enemy&rsquo;s guns were quickly spiked: this 
struggle lasted about an hour and a half.&nbsp; It was an awful 
time, about 3,000 of our brave soldiers were slain in this short 
period.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our hero Gordon, tells us that on the 
evening of this 8th of September&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard most terrific explosions, the earth seemed to 
be shaken to its very centre;&mdash;It was afterwards discovered 
the enemy&rsquo;s position was no longer tenable, so they had 
fired some 300 tons of gunpowder, which had blown up all their 
vast forts and magazines.&nbsp; O! what a night: many of our poor
fellows had been nearly buried in the <i>debris</i>, and burning 
mass: the whole of Sebastopol was in flames.&nbsp; The Russians 
were leaving it helter-skelter&mdash;a complete rout, and a heavy
but gloriously-won victory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For his acknowledged ability, his fine heroism, and his true 
loyalty to his superiors during this most trying campaign, he 
received the well-earned decoration of the Legion of Honour from 
the French Government, a mark of distinction very rarely 
conferred upon so young an officer.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>&ldquo;God gives us men, a time like 
that demands.<br />
Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;<br />
Men whom the lusts of office cannot kill,<br />
Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy,<br />
Men who possess opinions and a will,<br />
Men who have honour, men who never lie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must not leave this part of our story without a brief 
notice of one whose name will live in song and story, when this 
generation shall have passed away.&nbsp; Many noble English 
ladies bravely went out to nurse the suffering soldiers; but in 
this noble band was one whose name remains a synonym for kindly 
sympathy, tenderness and peace&mdash;Miss Florence 
Nightingale.</p>
<p>The following lines were written in her praise&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Britain has welcomed home with open hand<br
/>
Her gallant soldiers to their native land;<br />
But one alone the Nation&rsquo;s thanks did shun,<br />
Though Europe rings with all that she hath done;<br />
For when will shadow on the wall e&rsquo;er fail,<br />
To picture forth fair Florence Nightingale:<br />
Her deeds are blazoned on the scroll of fame,<br />
And England well may prize her deathless name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The greatness of a nation depends upon the 
men it can breed and rear.&mdash;<i>Froude</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The war over and peace duly established, Lieutenant Gordon 
(for so he was then) accompanied General Sir Lintorn Simmons to 
Galatz, where, as assistant commissioner, he was engaged in 
fixing the new frontiers of Russia, Turkey and Roumania.&nbsp; In
1857, when his duties here were finished, he went with the same 
officer to Armenia; there, in the same capacity, he was engaged 
in laying down the Asiatic frontiers of Russia and Turkey.&nbsp; 
When this work was completed he returned home and was quartered 
at Chatham, and employed for a time as Field Work Instructor and 
Adjutant.&nbsp; In 1860, now holding the rank of Captain, he 
joined the Army in China, and was present at the surrender of 
Pekin; and for his services he was promoted to the rank of 
Major.</p>
<h3><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>THE BURNING OF THE SUMMER PALACE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;On the eleventh of October,&rdquo; Gordon relates, 
&ldquo;we were sent down in a hurry to throw up earth works 
against the City; as the Chinese refused to give up the gate we 
demanded their surrender before we could treat with them.&nbsp; 
They were also required to give up the prisoners.&nbsp; You will 
be sorry to hear the treatment they have suffered has been very 
bad.&nbsp; Poor De Norman, who was with me in Asia, is one of the
victims.&nbsp; It appears they were tied so tight by the wrists 
that the flesh mortified, and they died in the greatest 
torture.&nbsp; Up to the time that elapsed before they arrived at
the Summer Palace, they were well treated, but then the 
ill-treatment began.&nbsp; The Emperor is supposed to have been 
there at the time.</p>
<p>But to go back to the work, the Chinese were given until 
twelve on the 13th, to give up the <!-- page 27--><a 
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>gate.&nbsp; 
We made a lot of batteries, and everything was ready for assault 
of the wall, which is a battlement, forty feet high, but of 
inferior masonry; at 11.30 p.m., however, the gate was opened, 
and we took possession; so our work was of no avail.&nbsp; The 
Chinese had then, until the 23rd, to think over our terms of 
treaty, and to pay up ten thousand pounds (&pound;10,000) for 
each Englishman, and five hundred pounds (&pound;500) for each 
native soldier who had died during their captivity.&nbsp; This 
they did, and the money was paid, and the treaty signed 
yesterday.&nbsp; I could not witness it, as all officers 
commanding companies were obliged to remain in camp, owing to the
ill-treatment the prisoners experienced at the Summer 
Palace.&nbsp; The General ordered this to be destroyed, and stuck
up proclamations to say why it was ordered.&nbsp; We accordingly 
went out, and after pillaging it, burned the whole magnificent 
palace, and destroyed most valuable property, which could not be 
replaced for millions of pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Palace&rdquo; (wrote the author of <i>Our Own 
Times</i>), &ldquo;covered an area of many miles.&nbsp; The 
Palace of Adrian, at Tivoli, might have been <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>hidden in one
of its courts.&nbsp; Gardens, temples, small lodges and pagodas, 
groves, grottoes, lakes, bridges, terraces, artificial hills, 
diversified the vast space.&nbsp; All the artistic treasures, all
the curiosities, arch&aelig;ological and other, that Chinese 
wealth and taste, such as it was, could bring 
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gordon notes, &ldquo;This palace, with its
surrounding buildings, over two hundred in number, covered an 
area eight by ten miles in extent.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says, 
&ldquo;it makes one&rsquo;s heart burn to see such beauty 
destroyed; it was as if Windsor Palace, South Kensington Museum, 
and British Museum, all in one, were in flames: you can scarcely 
imagine the beauty and magnificence of the things we were bound 
to destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These palaces were so large, and we were so pressed for
time, that we could not plunder them carefully.&nbsp; Quantities 
of gold ornaments were burned, considered as brass.&nbsp; It was 
wretchedly demoralizing for an army: everybody was wild for 
plunder . . .&nbsp; The throne and room were lined with ebony, 
carved in a wonderful manner.&nbsp; There were huge mirrors of 
all shapes and sizes, clocks, watches, musical boxes with puppets
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>on them, magnificent china of every description, heaps 
and heaps of silks of all colours, coral screens, large amounts 
of treasures, etc.&nbsp; The French have smashed up everything in
a most shameful way.&nbsp; It was a scene of utter destruction 
which passes my description.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was not much in 
Gordon&rsquo;s line.</p>
<p>In the following year he made a tour on horseback to the outer
wall of China at Kalgan, accompanied by Lieutenant Cardew.&nbsp; 
A Chinese lad of the age of fourteen, who knew a little English, 
acted as their servant and interpreter, while their personal 
luggage was conveyed in the Chinese carts.&nbsp; In the course of
this tour we are told they passed through districts which had 
never before been visited by any European.&nbsp; At Kalgan the 
great wall was seen, with its parapet about twenty-two feet high,
and sixteen feet broad.&nbsp; Both sides were solid brick, each 
being three times the size of our English bricks.&nbsp; Gordon 
writes: &ldquo;It is wonderful to see the long line of wall 
stretching over the hills as far as the eye can 
reach.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Kalgan they travelled westwards to 
Taitong; here they saw huge caravans of camels laden with tea 
going towards <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Russia.&nbsp; Here they were forced 
to have the axle trees of their carts widened, for they had come 
into a great part of the country where the wheels were set wider 
than in the provinces whence they came.&nbsp; Their carts, 
therefore, no longer fitted into the deep ruts which had been 
worn into the terribly bad roads.&nbsp; The main object of their 
journey was to find out if there was in the Inner Wall any pass 
besides the Tchatiaou which on that side of the country led from 
the Russian territory to Pekin.&nbsp; It was not until they 
reached Taiyuen that they struck the road that led to Pekin or 
Tientsin.</p>
<p>Their first bit of trouble on this somewhat venturesome tour 
occurred at Taiyneu; when the bill was brought for their 
night&rsquo;s entertainment, they found it was most 
exorbitant.&nbsp; They saw they were likely to have trouble, so 
they sent on the carts with luggage and waited at this strange 
hostelry till they believed they had got well out of the 
way.&nbsp; Then they offered what they believed was a reasonable 
amount in payment of their bill.&nbsp; It was refused.&nbsp; They
then tried to mount their horses but the people at the Inn 
stopped them.&nbsp; Major Gordon hereupon <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>drew his 
revolver more for show than for use, for he allowed them to take 
it from him.&nbsp; He then said, &ldquo;Let us go to the 
Mandarin&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this consent was given, 
and the two wide-awake English officers walked alongside their 
horses.&nbsp; On the way Gordon said to his companion &ldquo;are 
you ready to mount?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; So they mounted quietly, and went on with the 
people.&nbsp; When they reached the Mandarin&rsquo;s, they turned
their horses and galloped off after their carts as fast as they 
could, having paid what they believed a reasonable amount for 
expenses.&nbsp; The people yelled and rushed after them, but it 
was too late.&nbsp; Some distance from the place where they had 
spent the night they came upon the pass over the mountains which 
led down into the country, drained by the great Peiho 
river.&nbsp; &ldquo;The descent&rdquo; says Gordon, &ldquo;was 
terrible, and the cold so intense that raw eggs were frozen as 
hard as if they had been boiled half an hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; To add
to their troubles, the carts they had sent on in front had been 
attacked by robbers.&nbsp; They, however, with many difficulties 
managed to reach Tientsin in safety; their leave of absence <!-- 
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>had been exceeded by about fourteen days.&nbsp; In 1862 
Major Gordon left for Shanghai under the orders of Sir Charles 
Staveley who had been appointed to the command of the English 
forces in China.&nbsp; At the very time that England and France 
were at war with China, a terrible and far reaching rebellion was
laying waste whole provinces.&nbsp; An article in our London 
<i>Daily News</i> about this date said, &ldquo;But for Gordon the
whole Continent of China might have been a scene of utter and 
hopeless ruin and devastation.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the date he took 
charge of the &ldquo;ever victorious army,&rdquo; China was in a 
state of widespread anarchy and confusion.</p>
<p>This rebellion which Gordon was here authorized to suppress 
was called &ldquo;The Tai-ping rebellion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its rise 
was brought about by a strange mixture of incredulity and 
fanaticism, caused by some European Christian giving away his 
literature.&nbsp; A village demagogue named Hung-tsne-Shuen 
caught the idea, after reading the papers referred to, that he 
was inspired; that he was God, King, Emperor, and that he ought 
to rule; so, puffed up with pride and insatiable ambition, he 
began raising an army; and <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>aimed at 
nothing less than the usurpation of the &ldquo;Dragon 
Throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some thought him mad; but he gathered about 
him some 20,000 men whom he had influenced to believe in him as 
the &ldquo;Second Celestial Brother,&rdquo; and gave out he was a
seer of visions, a prophet of vengeance and freedom; a champion 
of the poor and oppressed; and many were mad enough to believe 
him, and thus he raised an army which grew in strength until it 
reached some hundreds of thousands strong; he then proclaimed 
himself the Heavenly King, The Emperor of the great place; and 
then with five wangs or warrior kings, chosen from amongst his 
kinsmen, he marched through China, devastating the country, and 
increasing his army in his progress.</p>
<p>The most populous, and until now wealthy provinces were soon 
in his hands.&nbsp; The silk factories were silent; the Cities 
were falling into utter and hopeless desolation: rebellion, war 
and famine, raged and reigned supreme.&nbsp; Gordon made them 
pause!&nbsp; His marvellous power of organizing and leading men, 
a power derived from an inflexible, determined, fearless, and 
deeply religious temperament, influenced the <!-- page 34--><a 
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Chinese 
character quickly and powerfully.&nbsp; His very name soon became
a terror to the banded brigands and to all evil doers.&nbsp; An 
Englishman in China at the time wrote home and said &ldquo;The 
destiny of China is in the hands of Major Gordon, and if he 
remains at his post the question will soon be settled, and peace 
and quiet will be restored to this unfortunate, but sorely tried 
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all the strange and trying experiences of this Chinese 
Campaign Gordon bore himself with a bravery and courage seldom 
equalled, we think never surpassed.</p>
<p>Dr. Guthrie once said, &ldquo;It is very remarkable, and 
highly creditable to the loyalty and bravery of our British 
soldiers, that, notwithstanding all the wars in which they have 
been engaged, no foreign nation to-day flaunts a British flag as 
a trophy of its victory and of our defeat.&nbsp; Nor in the proud
pillar raised by the great Napoleon in commemoration of his many 
victories&mdash;a pillar made of the cannons taken by him in 
battles, is there an ounce of metal that belongs to a British 
gun.&rdquo;&nbsp; The characteristics of the bravest of our 
British <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>soldiers were pre-eminently displayed
in Gordon.&nbsp; For&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He holds no party with unmanly fears,<br />
Where duty points he confidently steers:<br />
Faces a thousand dangers at her call,<br />
And trusting in his God surmounts them all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His soldierly qualities were very often put to the test in 
this strange land.&nbsp; Hung, the leader of this rebellion, had 
become so popular and made such marvellous progress that when 
Gordon had organized his ever victorious army, Hung had captured 
Nanking, one of the principal cities, and made this his capital; 
and here, under the very shadow of the Chinese metropolis, he 
established himself in royal state.&nbsp; His followers were held
together by the force of his religious tenets; they believed in 
him as the Lord from Heaven, who would save the suffering minds 
and give them a celestial reward.&nbsp; A missionary who was in 
Nanking, Rev. J. L. Holmes, gives his impressions of this warlike
devotee.&nbsp; &ldquo;At night (he says) we witnessed their 
worship.&nbsp; It occurred at the beginning of their sabbath, 
midnight on Friday.&nbsp; The place of worship was the 
Chung-Wang&rsquo;s private audience <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>room.&nbsp; 
He was himself seated in the midst of his attendants, no females 
were present.&nbsp; They first sang, or rather chanted; after 
which a written prayer was read, then burned by an officer; then 
they rose and sang again, then separated.&nbsp; The Chung-wang 
sent for me before he left his seat, and asked me if I understood
their mode of worship.&nbsp; I replied I had just seen it for the
first time.&nbsp; He explained that the Tien-wang had been to the
celestial world and had seen the Great God and obtained a 
revelation! &amp;c. . . .&nbsp; As the day dawned we started for 
the Palace of the Tien-wang.&nbsp; The procession was headed by a
number of brilliantly coloured banners, after which followed a 
troop of armed soldiers; then came the Chung-wang in a large 
sedan, covered with yellow satin and embroidery, and borne by 
eight coolies.&nbsp; Music of a peculiar kind added to the scene,
as the curious sightseers lined the streets on either side, who 
probably never saw such a sight before.&nbsp; Reaching the 
&ldquo;Morning Palace,&rdquo; we were presented to the Tsau-wang 
and his son with several others including the Tien-wang&rsquo;s 
two brothers, who were seated in a deep recess <!-- page 37--><a 
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>over the 
entrance of which was written &ldquo;Illustrious Heavenly 
Door.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another place was &ldquo;Holy Heavenly 
Gate,&rdquo; from which a boy of about fourteen made his 
appearance and took his place with the royal group; then they 
proceeded with their religious ceremonies again: this time 
kneeling with their faces to the Tien-wang&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp; 
Then they sang in a standing position.&nbsp; A roast pig and the 
body of a goat were lying with other articles on tables in the 
outer court, and a fire was kept burning on a stone altar in the 
front of the Tien-wang&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp; Afterwards, says the 
missionary, I was led through a number of rooms and courts to see
Chung-wang privately.&nbsp; I was brought into one of his private
sitting-rooms, where he sat clothed loosely in white silk, with a
red kerchief round his head, and a jewel in front.&nbsp; He was 
seated in an easy chair, and fanned by a pretty slipshod 
girl.&nbsp; He asked me to a seat beside him and questioned me 
about a map he had seen with parallel lines running each way, 
said to have been made by foreigners, asked me to explain what it
was.&nbsp; He also showed me a musical-box and a spy-glass, 
asking many <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>questions.&nbsp; From all I could 
learn by my visit to this pretender there was nothing in their 
religion to elevate, but everything to degrade.&nbsp; With them 
to rob and murder were virtuous deeds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Slay the 
imps&rdquo; was their watchword.&nbsp; Gordon found in this 
fanatic a foe of no mean order.&nbsp; But he soon found too that 
courage and faith in God had done and would still lead to 
victory.&nbsp; In a letter home he says&mdash;&ldquo;I am afraid 
you will be much vexed at my having taken the command of the 
Sung-kiang force, and that I am now a mandarin.&nbsp; I have 
taken the step on consideration.&nbsp; I think that any one who 
contributes to putting down this rebellion fulfils a human task, 
and also tends a great deal to open China to civilization.&nbsp; 
I will not act rashly, and I trust to be able soon to return to 
England; at the same time I will remember your and my 
father&rsquo;s wishes, and endeavour to remain as short a time as
possible.&nbsp; I can say that if I had not accepted the command 
I believe the force would have been broken up and the rebellion 
gone on in its misery for years.&nbsp; I trust this will not now 
be the case, and that I may soon be able to comfort you on this 
subject.&nbsp; You must not <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>fret about 
me, I think I am doing a good service . . .&nbsp; I keep your 
likeness before me, and can assure you and my father that I will 
not be rash, and that as soon as I can conveniently, and with due
regard to the object I have in view, I will come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon had hardly yet realized the difficulties and dangers 
which beset him.&nbsp; His troops were undisciplined and largely 
composed of all nationalities.&nbsp; Men bent on plunder, and 
exceedingly numerous; about 120,000 men.&nbsp; Gordon&rsquo;s 
appointment as Chief in Command of the &ldquo;Ever Victorious 
Army&rdquo; proved to be a wise and good one for China.</p>
<p>Colonel Chesney thus writes:&mdash;&ldquo;If General Staveley 
had made a mistake in the operations he personally conducted the 
year before, he more than redeemed it by the excellence of his 
choice of Gordon.&nbsp; This strange army was made up of French, 
Germans, Americans, Spaniards, some of good and some of bad 
character, but in their chief they had one whose courage they 
were bound to admire, and whose justice they could not help but 
admit.&nbsp; The private plundering of vanquished towns and 
cities allowed <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>under their former chief, disappeared
under the eye of a leader whose eye was as keen, as his soul was 
free from the love of filthy lucre.&nbsp; They, however, learned 
to respect and love a general in whose kindness, valour, skill, 
and justice they found cause unhesitatingly to confide; who never
spared himself personal exposure when danger was near.&nbsp; In 
every engagement, and these numbered more than seventy, he was to
the front and led in person.&nbsp; His somewhat undisciplined 
army, had in it many brave men; but even such men were very 
reluctant at times to face these desperate odds.&nbsp; Whenever 
they showed signs of vacillation he would take one of the men by 
the arm, and lead him into the very thick of the fight.&nbsp; He 
always went unarmed even when foremost in the breach.&nbsp; He 
never saw danger.&nbsp; A shower of bullets was no more to him 
than a shower of hailstones; he carried one weapon only, and that
was a little cane, which won for itself the name of 
&ldquo;Gordon&rsquo;s magic wand.&rdquo;&nbsp; On one occasion 
when leading a storming party his men wavered under a most 
withering fire.&nbsp; Gordon coolly turned round and waving his 
cane, bade his men follow him.&nbsp; <!-- page 41--><a 
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>The soldiers 
inspired by his courage, followed with a tremendous rush and 
shout, and at once grandly carried the position.&nbsp; After the 
capture of one of the Cities, Gordon was firm in not allowing 
them to pillage, sack and burn such places; and for this some of 
his men showed a spirit of insubordination.&nbsp; His artillery 
men refused to fall in when ordered; nay more, they threatened to
turn upon him their guns and blow him and his officers to 
pieces.&nbsp; This news was conveyed to him by a written 
declaration.&nbsp; His keen eye saw through their scheme at a 
glance, and with that quiet determination which was his peculiar 
strength, he summoned them into his presence and with a firmness 
born of courage and faith in God, he declared that unless the 
ringleader of this movement was given up, one out of every five 
would be shot!&nbsp; At the same time he stepped to the front and
with his own hand seized one of the most suspicious looking of 
the men, dragged him out, and ordered him to be shot on the spot 
at once, the order was instantly carried out by an officer.&nbsp;
After this he gave them half an hour to reconsider their position
at the end of which he found them <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>ready to 
carry out any order he might give.&nbsp; It transpired afterwards
that the man who was shot was the ringleader in this 
insubordination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Gordon had broken the neck of this far-reaching and 
disastrous rebellion, and had restored to the Emperor of China 
the principal cities and towns in peace, the London <i>Times</i> 
wrote of him:&mdash;&ldquo;Never did a soldier of fortune deport 
himself with a nicer sense of military honour, with more 
gallantry against the resisting, with more mercy towards the 
vanquished, with more disinterested neglect of opportunities of 
personal advantage, or with more entire devotion to the objects 
and desires of the Government he served, than this officer, who, 
after all his splendid victories, has just laid down his 
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving China he was offered a very large reward in 
cash, as it was acknowledged on all hands he had saved the Empire
more than &pound;5,000,000 sterling.&nbsp; All money he refused; 
he, however, asked that some of it might be given to the troops, 
who had served him on the whole with great loyalty, and this was 
granted.&nbsp; A gold medal was struck in honour of his <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
43</span>marvellous achievements, and this he accepted and 
brought home; but it was soon missing.&nbsp; He thought more of 
the starving poor than of any medal; so he sold it, and sent the 
cash it realized to the Lancashire Cotton Operatives, who were 
then literally starving.&nbsp; The Imperial Decree of China 
conferred upon him the rank of &ldquo;Ti-tu,&rdquo; the very 
highest honour ever conferred upon a Chinese subject.&nbsp; Also 
the &ldquo;Peacock&rsquo;s feather,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Order of 
the Star,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Yellow Jacket.&rdquo;&nbsp; By 
these he was constituted one of the &ldquo;Emperor&rsquo;s Body 
Guard.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a letter home he says, &ldquo;I shall 
leave China as poor as I entered it, but with the knowledge that 
through my weak instrumentality from eighty to one hundred 
thousand lives have been saved.&nbsp; Than this I covet no 
greater satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he left China, as a proof of the estimation in which he
was held, a grand illuminated address was presented to him, 
signed by more than sixty of the leading firms of the Empire, and
by most of the bankers and merchants of the cities of Pekin, 
Shanghai, and of the principal towns throughout China.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>It read thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Honoured Sir,&mdash;On the 
eve of your departure to your native country, we, the 
undersigned, mostly fellow-countrymen of your own, but also 
representing other nationalities, desire to express to you our 
earnest wish for a successful voyage and happy return to your 
friends and the land of your birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your career during your stay amongst us has been, so

the line of conduct which you personally have pursued.&nbsp; In a
position of unequalled difficulty, and surrounded by 
complications of every conceivable nature, you have succeeded in 
offering to the eyes of the Chinese Empire, no less by your loyal
and thoroughly disinterested line of action than by your 
conspicuous gallantry and talent for organization and command, 
the example of a foreign officer, serving the government of this 
country, with honourable fidelity and undeviating

long career of usefulness and success.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Signed, &amp;c.</p>
<p>There is truth in this as applied to Gordon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He strove not for the wealth of fame,<br />
From heaven the power that moved him came.<br />
And welcome as the mountain air,<br />
The voice that bid him do and dare.<br />
Onward he bore and battled still<br />
With a most firm enduring will,<br />
His only hope to win the prize<br />
Laid up for him beyond the skies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Emperor wished the British Minister to bring before the 
notice of Her Majesty the Queen of England his appreciation of 
the splendid services which Gordon had rendered.&nbsp; He hoped 
that he would be rewarded in England as well as in China for his 
heroic achievements.</p>
<p>A subsequent letter in the <i>Times</i> said that Prince Kung,
who was then the Regent of China, had waited upon Sir Frederick 
Bruce, and said to him, &ldquo;You will be astonished to see me 
again, but I felt I could not allow you to leave without coming 
to see you about Gordon.&nbsp; We do not know what to do.&nbsp; 
He will not <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>receive money from us, and we have 
already given him every honour which it is in the power of the 
Emperor to bestow; but as these are of little value in his eyes, 
I have brought you this letter, and I ask you to give it to the 
Queen of England that she may bestow on him some reward which 
would be more valuable in his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Bruce sent this to London with a letter of his 
own:&mdash;&ldquo;I enclose translation of a despatch from Prince
Kung, containing the decree published by the Emperor, 
acknowledging the services of Gordon and requesting that Her 
Majesty&rsquo;s Government be pleased to recognise him.&nbsp; 
Gordon well deserves the favours of your Majesty for the skill 
and courage he has shown, his disinterestedness has elevated our 
national character in the eyes of the Chinese.&nbsp; Not only has
he refused any pecuniary reward, but he has spent more than his 
pay in contributing to the comforts of the officers who served 
under him, and in assuaging the distress of the starving 
population whom he relieved from the yoke of their 
oppressors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>It does not appear that this letter was ever sent to the
Queen, or noticed by the Government, and so the heroic deeds of a
man of whom any nation might justly be proud, were forgotten.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Our hero having returned to his native land, and to settle for
a little while at the quiet town of Gravesend, refused to be 
lionized, and he begged that no publication of his deeds of 
daring and devotion in China, should be recorded.&nbsp; His quiet
life here as an engineer was not less remarkable, though of a 
different kind, than life in China had been.&nbsp; Here, however,
he spent the energies of his spare time, to the services of the 
poor.&nbsp; At this juncture I was privileged to come in contact 
with this remarkable man, in the great city of Manchester, where 
for a few months, he was employed on some Governmental 
Commission.&nbsp; Like his Master Christ&mdash;he went about 
doing good.&nbsp; My position at this time was an agent, or 
scripture <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>reader for &ldquo;The Manchester City
Mission.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gordon found his way to the office and saw 
the chairman of the mission, and from him got permission to 
accompany one of the missioners round his district.&nbsp; He 
expressed his desire to go round one of the poorest districts of 
the city; as it might afford him an opportunity of seeing for 
himself some of the social blots and scars in our national life; 
also of giving some practical help to the deserving poor.&nbsp; 
My district was such an one as would furnish him with the 
opportunities to satisfy him in that particular, and I was 
therefore asked to allow Col. Gordon to accompany me to its 
squalid scenes, to my Ragged School, cottage and open-air 
services, and to the sick and suffering, of which I had many on 
my list.&nbsp; This request was gladly complied with; for the 
first sight of the stranger made me love and trust him.</p>
<p>And now the hero of so many battles fought for freedom and 
liberty, was to witness scenes of warfare of a very different 
kind.&nbsp; War, it is true, but not where there are garments 
rolled in blood and victims slain; but war with the powers of 
darkness, war between good and evil, <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>truth and 
error, light and darkness.&nbsp; We went together into the lowest
slums of the district; walked arm in arm over the ground where 
misery tells its sad and awful tale, where poverty shelters its 
shivering frame, and where blasphemy howls its curse.&nbsp; We 
found out haunts of vice and sin, terrible in their character, 
and distressing in their consequences.&nbsp; I found he had not 
hitherto been accustomed to this kind of mission.&nbsp; Once on 
my entering a den of dangerous characters and lecturing them on 
their sinful course and warning them in unmistakable words of the
consequences, he afterwards said: &ldquo;I could not have found 
courage of the kind you show in this work; yet I never was 
considered lacking in courage on the field of battle.&nbsp; When 
in the Crimea, I was sent frequently and went on hands and knees 
through the fall of shells and the whizz of bullets right up to 
the Russian walls to watch their movements, and I never felt 
afraid; I confess I need courage to warn men of sin and its 
dangerous consequences.&rdquo;&nbsp; He met me, for a time almost
daily, well supplied with tracts, which I noticed he used as a 
text for a few words of <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>advice, or comfort, or warning as the
case required, but he invariably left a silver coin between the 
leaves; this I think was a proof he was sincere in his efforts to
do good.&nbsp; Along Old Millgate, and around the Cathedral, at 
that time, were numerous courts and alleys, obscure, often 
filthy, dark and dangerous; down or up these he accompanied me; 
up old rickety staircases, into old crumbling ruins of garrets he
followed without hesitation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At the bedside of the dying prodigal or prostitute he would 
sit with intense interest, pointing them to Him who casts out 
none.&nbsp; In our house to house visitation he would sit down 
and read of the Saviour&rsquo;s love, making special reference to
those that are poor in this world, assuring them it was for the 
outcast and the forsaken, and the lost, that Jesus came to 
die.&nbsp; He would kneel down for prayer by a broken chair or 
the corner of a slop-stone, or by the wash-tub, and with the 
simplicity of a child, address in tender and touching petition, 
the Great Father of all in Heaven, while tears chased each other 
down his sun-tanned face; his great soul going out with his 
prayer for Heaven&rsquo;s blessing on the helpless poor.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>His sympathy was tender as a child&rsquo;s, and his 
beneficence as liberal as the best of Christian&rsquo;s can 
be.&nbsp; He often came and took tea with me in my quiet home, 
where we had many very interesting interviews, and where we 
conversed on subjects varied but mostly religious; he rarely 
referred to his military achievements; when he did so it was with
the greatest self abnegation and humility.&nbsp; He would say, 
&ldquo;No honour belongs to me, I am only the instrument God uses
to accomplish his purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; I introduced him to my 
ragged school; this to him was a most interesting scene of work, 
and he volunteered to give us some of his time and service; and 
to see him with 20 or 30 of these ragged lads about him was to 
say the least, full of interest.&nbsp; He, however, had the happy
art of getting at their heart at once; by incidents, stories and 
experiences, which compelled attention and confidence.&nbsp; In a
very short time he won the esteem and the love of every lad in 
the school.&nbsp; To some of these lads he became specially 
attached, and for some time after he left Manchester he kept up 
with me, and with several of the lads, also with some of my <!-- 
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>colleagues on the mission&mdash;a very interesting 
correspondence.&nbsp; Happily, I have preserved a good number of 
these letters, and they show the spirit and motive of that noble 
soul, more than any poor words of mine can do.</p>
<blockquote><p>Letter.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Gravesend</span>,<br />
<i>June 19th</i>, <i>1869</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Dear Mr. Wardle.&mdash;My long silence has not been 
because I had forgot you and your kind reception of me; but 
because secular work has so completely taken up my time of 
late.&nbsp; I was glad to hear of you . . . . and of the Dark 
Lane (ragged school) lads.&nbsp; I often wish I could go down 
with you and see them; I often think of them.&nbsp; I wish I 
could help them, but it is only by prayer that I can now benefit 
them.&nbsp; I loved them very much, and look forward to the time 
when our weary march, dogged by our great foe will be ended; and 
we meet for ever in our Heavenly home.&nbsp; I remember them all,
Jones, Carr, &amp;c., &amp;c., and I often think of their poor 
young faces which must soon get deepened into wrinkles with 
sorrow and care.&nbsp; Thank God we go like Israel of old, after 
a new home; we cannot find our rest here!&nbsp; Day by day we 
are, little as we may think it, a day&rsquo;s march nearer, till 
someday we shall perhaps unexpectedly reach it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Good bye, my dear Mr. Wardle,<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">C. H. Gordon</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Kind regards to <i>my</i> 
lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>Gordon was deeply moved by the sights of poverty and 
distress around him; this was shown by the dress and appearance 
of the factory hands.&nbsp; He was especially struck by the 
clatter of the clogs&mdash;the Lancashire cotton 
operative&rsquo;s foot gear.</p>
<p>To his Sister he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Manchester</span>,<br />
<i>September 21st</i>, <i>1867</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your heart would bleed to see the poor people, though 
they say there is no distress such as there was some time ago; 
they are indeed like sheep having no shepherd, but, thank God, 
though they look forlorn, they have a watchful and pitying eye 
upon them.&nbsp; It does so painfully affect me, and I do trust 
will make me think less of self, and more of these poor 
people.&nbsp; Little idea have the rich of other countries of the
scenes in these parts.&nbsp; It does so make me long for that 
great day when He will come and put all things straight.</p>
<p>How long, O Lord, how long!</p>
<p>I have but little time to write by this post, so will say no 
more about that.&nbsp; I have less confidence in the flesh than 
ever, thank God, though it is a painful struggle and makes one 
long for the time when, this our earthly tabernacle, shall be 
dissolved; but may His will be done.&nbsp; If there is sin and 
misery, there is One who over-rules all things for good; we must 
be patient.&nbsp; The poor scuttlers here, male and <!-- page 
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>female, fill me with sorrow.&nbsp; They wear wooden 
clogs, a sort of sabot, and make such a noise.&nbsp; Good-bye, 
and may God manifest Himself in all His power to all of you, and 
make you to rejoice with joy unspeakable.&nbsp; If we think of 
it, the only thing which makes the religion of our Lord Jesus 
Christ differ from that of every other religion, or profession, 
is this very indwelling of God the Holy Ghost in our bodies; we 
can do nothing good; Christ says, &ldquo;Without me, ye can do 
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; You are dead in trespasses and sins, you 
are corpses, and must have life put in you, and that life is God 
Himself, who dwells in us, and shows us the things of 
Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gordon was intensely and deeply religious; it was in him 
certainly &ldquo;as a well of water springing up into everlasting
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could talk of nothing else, in whatever 
company, it was the same theme&mdash;&ldquo;Christ in you the 
hope of glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; A favourite text of his was 1. John, 
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>chap. 4, ver. 15&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever shall confess 
that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in 
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; This he took as a text for a little homily 
which he printed and circulated by thousands.&nbsp; After the 
above head-line, in special type, it ran 
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Reader!&nbsp; Do you confess that Jesus is the
Son of God?&nbsp; Do you believe in your heart that Jesus is the 
Son of God?&nbsp; If you do then God dwells in you to-day.&nbsp; 
Whatever you are, whatever you have been, or have done,&mdash;and
if you ask Him, &lsquo;O Lord, I believe that Jesus is the Son of
God; show me, for His sake, that Thou livest in me.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
He will make you feel His presence in your hearts, and will make 
you feel perfectly happy, which you cannot be in any other 
way.&nbsp; Many believe sincerely that Jesus is the Son of God, 
but are not happy, because they do not believe <span 
class="smcap">that</span> which God tells them&mdash;that He 
lives in them both in body and soul, transforming the whole man 
into the likeness of Jesus Christ, if they confess Jesus to be 
His son.&nbsp; Do you believe this statement?&nbsp; If you do, 
yet do not feel God&rsquo;s presence, ask Him to show Himself to 
you, and He will surely do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
60</span>After this homily, on the same tract, were the following
passages of Scripture:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Luke, chap. 2, v. 13.&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye then 
being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children; how 
much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them
that ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rom., chap. 10, v. 9.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou shall confess with 
thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that 
God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be 
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I. Cor., chap. 3, v. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;Know ye not that ye are 
the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I. Cor., chap. 6, v. 19.&nbsp; &ldquo;Know ye not that your 
body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye 
have of God, and ye are not your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II. Cor., chap. 6, v. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are the temple of 
the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk 
in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my 
people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tone and spirit of this tract, is the kernel, if I may say
so, of his deepest religious convictions.</p>
<p>He gave me a number of New Testaments for distribution, as he 
did also to one or two others of our missioners.&nbsp; The 
following letter accompanies the parcel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Wardle,&mdash;I 
have sent thirty Testaments for you and thirty for Mr. 
Fielden.&nbsp; Will you kindly oblige by marking in each the 
following passages, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>Matt. chap. 2, V. 28, 29.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye 
that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you 
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek 
and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your 
souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gal. ch. 5, v., 19., 25.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now the works of the 
flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, 
uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, 
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
21.&nbsp; Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such 
like; of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in 
time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the 
Kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; 22.&nbsp; But the fruit of the 
Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, 23.&nbsp; Meekness, temperance; against such there is no 
law.&nbsp; 42.&nbsp; And they that are Christ&rsquo;s have 
crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.&nbsp; If we 
live in the spirit, let us walk in the spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also I John ch. 4, v. 15.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever shall 
confess, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also published a little work entitled &ldquo;Christ and His
members; or the in-dwelling of God, the root of faith in 
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; One or two quotations may be sufficient to 
show the nature or scope of the work, a copy now lies before 
me.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>&ldquo;Belief or faith in Jesus being the Son of God, is
the distinguishing spiritual mark of the members of 
Christ&rsquo;s body; it is a fruit which springs from a root, or 
source, from which it is sustained, and increased.&nbsp; This 
root is the indwelling of God the Holy Ghost in the soul.&nbsp; 
This indwelling gives faith or belief in the fact that even as 
the sun gives light, or the fire gives warmth, and as there can 
be no warmth without fire, and no light without the sun, neither 
can there be any belief in Jesus, without the indwelling of God 
in the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote me from Liverpool as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Wardle, do not forget to take 
the Testaments on Tuesday night.&nbsp; I always carry some with 
me, and always regret if I am taken by surprise, and have not 
any.</p>
<p>Read and delight in &ldquo;The tongue of fire,&rdquo; 
especially the first four or five chapters.&nbsp; If a man would 
be the instrument of winning souls to his Lord, it is utterly 
impossible for him to do so except through and by the Holy 
Ghost.&nbsp; He must be loving the praise of God, more than that 
of man.&nbsp; He must be humble, mean spirited it is called by 
many; even sometimes by his friends: and he can only be mean 
spirited by living near God.&nbsp; Let a man live distant from 
God, who is light, and he will not think he is so bad, but will 
think himself a little better than others, but let him live near 
God, and as he lives near Him he will feel himself worse than the
worst; such is the power of the glorious light . . . .&nbsp; 
Goodbye; kind regards to all.</p>

<p>A son of one of our missionaries (J. Johnson) says of Gordon 
&ldquo;he was one of the most unassuming and gentle men I ever 
met; and I well remember his saintly conversation, as he sat at 
tea with us.&nbsp; I also remember, (though only a youth) being 
struck with his humility, especially for one of his rank and 
profession.&nbsp; He generally had on a well worn greyish 
overcoat, the side pockets of which gaped somewhat with constant 
usage for into them he would cram a large number of tracts and 
sally forth in company with me or another of the missionaries, or
as sometimes happened he went alone, drop a tract here or there 
and speak a seasonable word.&nbsp; He <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>spoke to me 
as a youth, as some of our saintly old pastors used to do to the 
children of the penniless where they stayed.&nbsp; He wrote me 
occasionally.&nbsp; A specimen I herewith append.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letter to Mr. Johnson, junr.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear J. . . . since we had a few words 
together you have not been out of my mind for any length of time 
together, and I was very glad to hear of you to-day from your 
father.&nbsp; God acts in mysterious ways and He gave me comfort 
concerning you on that evening.&nbsp; Trust Him with all thine 
heart.&nbsp; He says (He who cannot lie) He lives in you if you 
believe that Jesus is the Son of God.&nbsp; His word is truth 
whatever may be our feelings, which change as the clouds.&nbsp; 
You are my dear friend, saved not on account of your feelings, 
but because our blessed Lord loved you unto death, and has washed
you in His own blood . . . .&nbsp; I will not write more than 
express my hope that He who has begun a good work may perfect 
it.&nbsp; Yea he surely will, for He says He will perfect that 
which concerneth us&mdash;make you useful in His service.&nbsp; 
May He strengthen you to fight the good fight of faith, and give 
you that crown of glory which fadeth not away; I am very sure He 
will.&nbsp; May His will be done on this poor sorrowing world, 
for the longer we live the more fleeting are its glories.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>Also a further letter to Mr. Johnson.&nbsp; This was 
written during my illness and leave of absence from 
duty&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Johnson, I have received your 
letter with many thanks.&nbsp; I am so much obliged for your 
letting me know of <span class="smcap">my lads</span>, and have 
written to them a few lines.&nbsp; I wish sometimes I was with 
you.&nbsp; I like your quiet earnestness; there is little of that
here, and I like the work; I have also said a few words to your 
son; the Holy Ghost is the teacher for Him, and will not leave 
His work till he is happy.</p>
<p>I hope Mr. Wardle is improving in health.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he 
shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Silver is spoilt if heated too much, therefore the refiner sits 
watching; until it is purified when the refiner sees his image 
reflected in its surface; so with us, our Lord will see that we 
are not too much heated, only just enough to reflect His 
image.&nbsp; Will you thank Mr. Fielden for his kind letter, I 
quite feel for his trials in that district, but he has a fellow 
helper and worker in his kind Lord who feels for him and will 
support him through all.&nbsp; Give my kind regard to Spence, 
your wife and son, and to all my friends.</p>
<p>And believe me my dear Mr. Johnson,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">C. G. Gordon</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Johnson writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One evening after I had been observing his 
patient endurance and perseverance with one of the reckless, <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>insolent lads as we left the school, I, in a quiet 
pleasant way remarked &ldquo;I fear Colonel, your Christian work 
in Dark Lane Ragged School will never get the fame and applause 
from this world that your military achievements in China have 
lately secured for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir,&rdquo; he replied &ldquo;If I can but be 
the means in the hands of God of leading any of these precious 
sons to Jesus, I must place that amongst the most glorious 
trophies of my life, and to hear the Master at last say 
&lsquo;Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these, 
ye have done it unto Me,&rsquo; will be to me a resplendent 
undying glory when so many of earth&rsquo;s fleeting honours have
tarnished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible (says Lord Blatchford about General 
Gordon) to imagine a man more completely in the presence of God, 
or more absolutely careless of his own distinction, comfort, 
wealth or life.&nbsp; A man unreservedly devoted to the cause of 
the oppressed.&nbsp; One bows before him as before a man of a 
superior order of things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Boulger says, 
&ldquo;There will never be another Gordon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir 
William Butler said of him, &ldquo;He was unselfish as Sydney; of
courage, dauntless as Wolfe; of honour, stainless as Outram; of 
sympathy, wide-reaching as Drummond; of honesty, <!-- page 
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>straightforward as Napier; of faith, as steadfast as 
Moore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe Gordon answered to all these encomiums and well 
deserved them.</p>
<p>Edgmont Hake, writing of him says:&mdash;&ldquo;He lived 
wholly for others; his home at Gravesend was school, hospital, 
church, and almshouse all in one.&nbsp; His work more like that 
of a Home missionary than of a military officer.&nbsp; The 
troubles of all interested him alike, but he had a warm corner in
his heart for lads.&rdquo;&nbsp; This will be seen from letters 
produced.&nbsp; Many of the lads he rescued from the slums and 
gutters; he cleaned them, clothed them, fed them, and gave them 
shelter and home, sometimes for weeks and even longer.&nbsp; He 
taught in the evenings lessons suitable to their conditions; not 
forgetting the moral and spiritual side of his work.&nbsp; And he
did this work without fee or reward, and he did it with all his 
heart.&nbsp; He was as enthusiastic about this duty as he was 
about his military duties.&nbsp; He called these lads 
&ldquo;<i>His kings</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s ideal of a king describes very closely 
Gordon&rsquo;s ideal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not the wealth that
makes a king<br />
Nor the purple colouring,<br />
Nor a brow that&rsquo;s bound with gold,<br />
Nor gate on mighty hinges rolled;<br />
That king is he who void of fear,<br />
Can look abroad with bosom clear,<br />
Who can tread ambition down,<br />
Nor be swayed by smile nor frown,<br />
Nor for all the treasure cares,<br />
That mine conceals or harvest wears,<br />
Or that golden sands deliver,<br />
Bosomed on a glassy river,<br />
Safe with wisdom for his crown,<br />
He looks on all things calmly down,<br />
He has no fear of earthly thing,<br />
This is it that makes a king,<br />
And all of us who e&rsquo;er we be<br />
May carve us out such royalty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one occasion a lad in the employ of a Gravesend tradesman 
was discovered to have been pilfering on a somewhat serious 
scale.&nbsp; When the fact was proved beyond question, the master
declared he would have the boy punished by imprisonment.&nbsp; 
The mother of the boy, hearing of this sad affair, was almost 
broken-hearted, and at her wit&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Someone who had
heard of Gordon&rsquo;s love for lads, also his <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>intense 
desire to help all in trouble, suggested that she should see him 
and explain her case.&nbsp; So, with all a mother&rsquo;s 
earnestness, she went at once to Gordon and told him the whole 
story, and begged with tears for his sympathy and help.&nbsp; 
After hearing the story his heart was touched, he could not 
refuse a mother&rsquo;s appeal.&nbsp; When a mother pleads, there
is power and pathos difficult for any to withstand, much less 
Gordon.&nbsp; So he went to the lad&rsquo;s late employer, and 
after considerable argument, the master undertook not to 
prosecute, but only on condition that Gordon would personally 
undertake to look after the lad himself, for one year at 
least.&nbsp; This Gordon promised, and he took the boy to his own
home, sent him to a good school at his own expense for the year; 
then he got him a good situation on board one of Her 
Majesty&rsquo;s vessels.&nbsp; That lad became a man of honour 
and respectability, secured good situations, won for himself a 
good character, and the mother and the sailor boy in their heart 
often blessed Gordon, who saved the boy from prison, ruin and 
disgrace, and the mother from a broken heart.&nbsp; His rescue 
work amongst boys was work he loved <!-- page 71--><a 
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>supremely, in
it he found his highest joys.&nbsp; His pleasures were not 
secured where many seek them, viz., at the theatre, at the 
gambling-house, at the racecourse, at the public-house, or in 
accumulating wealth, or in winning renown and glory&mdash;these 
were nothing to Gordon.&nbsp; To save a fallen lad, was to him 
the highest gratification; in this work he was very 
successful.</p>
<p>Many a rescued lad was he able to restore to his home and to 
society, and to the world.&nbsp; For many of these lads he was 
able to secure situations on board ship.&nbsp; To show his 
interest in them when away he had a large map on his study wall, 
in this map were pins in very many places.&nbsp; These, he told a
visitor, showed the position of the ships on which his lads were 
located; and he moved the pins as the ships moved and prayed for 
each boy from day to day.&nbsp; The workhouse and the infirmary 
were places he used to visit, and his visits were remembered by 
the inmates, as all the fruits and flowers he could grow were 
given to these places and to the sick and poor whom he 
visited.&nbsp; Very often the dying sent for him in preference to
a clergyman, and he was, if at home, always ready; <!-- page 
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>no 
matter what the weather or what the distance.&nbsp; His works 
were essentially works of charity, and these were not done to be 
seen of men.&nbsp; He was one of the humblest men I ever 
met.&nbsp; He would not occupy the chair at a meeting or even go 
on to the platform.&nbsp; Once I remember he addressed a 
gathering after tea of those who had been rescued and who were 
likely to be useful to others, but he would not be lionised or 
praised.&nbsp; He would say, &ldquo;No; I am but the instrument: 
the praise belongs to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; His spirit was the 
fruitful cause of all the work he did.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give me that lowest place,<br />
Not that I dare ask for that lowest place.<br />
But Thou hast died that I might share<br />
Thy glory by Thy side.<br />
Give me that lowest place, or if for me<br />
That lowest place too high<br />
Make one more low, where I may sit<br />
And see my God; and love Thee so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He recognised &ldquo;that pure religion and undefiled before 
God the Father is this, to visit the fatherless, and the widows 
in their affliction, and to keep unspotted from the 
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; This <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>kindled his 
enthusiasm, influenced his chivalrous character, and we think had
largely to do with his success.&nbsp; To know him was to know a 
Christian, a Christlike man&mdash;God&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>With Job (ch. 29, verses 11, 12, etc.) he could say 
truly&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; 
when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me.&nbsp; Because I 
delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless, and him that 
had none to help him.&nbsp; The blessing of him that was ready to
perish came upon me: and I caused the widow&rsquo;s heart to sing
for joy.&nbsp; I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the 
lame.&nbsp; I was a father to the poor, and the cause which I 
knew not I searched out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He could truly say</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I live for those that love me:<br />
For those that know me true;<br />
For the heaven that smiles above me<br />
And waits my coming too.<br />
For the cause that needs assistance,<br />
For the wrong that needs resistance.<br />
For the future in the distance,<br />
And for the good that I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon his removal from Gravesend in 1873 a local newspaper

loss, said&mdash;&ldquo;Our readers will hear with regret of the

charity that will long be remembered.&nbsp; Nor will he be less 
missed than remembered, for in the lowest walks of life he has 
been so unwearied in well-doing that his departure will be felt 
as a terrible calamity.&nbsp; His charity was essential charity, 
having its root in deep philanthropic feeling and goodness, and 
always shunning the light of publicity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many were 
the friends who grieved over his departure from Gravesend, for 
they ne&rsquo;er would look upon his like again.</p>

<p>A new chapter now opens in our story of Gordon.&nbsp; Sir 
Samuel Baker had resigned the honoured position of Governor 
General of the Soudan.&nbsp; Gordon was selected as the man who, 
of all others, was most suitable for such an appointment.&nbsp; 
Our Government acquiesced in the Khedive&rsquo;s offer of this 
post to Gordon, so he accepted the responsible position.</p>
<p>The Khedive offered him, it is stated, a salary &pound;10,000 
per annum; this, however, he refused to accept.&nbsp; He said 
&ldquo;Your Majesty I cannot accept it, as I should look upon it 
as the life&rsquo;s blood wrung out of those poor people over 
whom you wish me to rule.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Name your own terms
then,&rdquo; said the Khedive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied 
Gordon, &ldquo;&pound;2,000 per annum I think will keep <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>body 
and soul together, what should I require more than this 
for.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the close of the year 1873 he left his 
country and loved ones behind him, for that lone sad land, with 
its ancient history.&nbsp; We think Gordon played such a part 
that his name will be honourably associated with Egypt, and 
remembered from generation to generation.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the author of <i>Gordon in Central Africa</i>
for the following abstract of the Khedive&rsquo;s final 
instructions to Col. Gordon, dated Feb. 16th, 1874.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The province which Colonel Gordon has 
undertaken to organise and to govern is but little known.&nbsp; 
Up to the last few years, it had been in the hands of adventurers
who had thought of nothing but their own lawless gains, and who 
had traded in ivory and slaves.&nbsp; They established factories 
and governed them with armed men.&nbsp; The neighbouring tribes 
were forced to traffic with them whether they liked it or 
not.&nbsp; The Egyptian Government, in the hope of putting an end
to this inhuman trade had taken the factories into their own 
hands, paying the owners an indemnification.</p>
<p>Some of these men, nevertheless, had been still allowed to 
carry on trade in the district, under a promise that they would 
not deal in slaves.&nbsp; They had been placed under the control 
of the Governor of the Soudan.&nbsp; His authority, <!-- page 
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>however, had scarcely been able to make itself felt in 
these remote countries.&nbsp; The Khedive had resolved therefore 
to form them into a separate government, and to claim as a 
monopoly of the State, the whole of the trade with the outside 
world.&nbsp; There was no other way of putting an end to the 
slave trade which at present was carried on by force of arms in 
defiance of law.&nbsp; When once brigandage had become a thing of
the past, and when once a breach had been made in the lawless 
customs of long ages, then trade might be made free to all.&nbsp;
If the men who had been in the pay of adventurers were willing to
enter the service of the Government, Col. Gordon was to make all 
the use of them he could.&nbsp; If on the other hand they 
attempted to follow their old course of life, whether openly or 
secretly, he was to put in force against them to the utmost 
severity of martial law.&nbsp; Such men as these must find in the
Governor neither indulgence, nor mercy.&nbsp; The lesson must be 
made clear even in those remote parts that a mere difference of 
colour does not turn men into wares, and that life and liberty 
are sacred things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another object of the new Governor should be to establish a 
line of posts through all his provinces, so that from one end to 
the other they might be brought into direct communication with 
Khartoum.&nbsp; Those posts should follow, as far as was 
possible, the line of the Nile; but for a distance of seventy 
miles the navigation of <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>that river was hindered by 
rapids.&nbsp; He was to search out the best way of overcoming 
this hindrance, and to make a report thereon to the Khedive.</p>
<p>In dealing with the <i>Chieftains</i> of the tribes which 
dwelt on the shores of the lakes, the Governor was above all to 
try to win their confidence.&nbsp; He must respect their 
territory, and conciliate them by presents, and whatever 
influence he gains over them, he must use in the endeavour to 
persuade them to put an end to the wars, which they so often make
on each other in the hope of carrying off slaves.&nbsp; Much tact
would be needed, for should he succeed in stopping the slave 
trade, while wars were still waged among the chiefs, it might 
well come to pass that, for want of a market, the prisoners 
would, in such a case, be slaughtered.&nbsp; Should he find it 
needful to exercise a real control over any of these tribes, it 
will be better to leave to the chieftains the direct 
government.&nbsp; Their obedience must be secured by making them 
dread his power.</p>
<p>He made the journey to Khartoum without any mishap or serious 
difficulty, reaching there <!-- page 79--><a 
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>in May, 1874,
and was installed in office on the fifth.&nbsp; A royal salute 
from the government house guns was fired in honour of this event;
the new Governor-General was, of course, expected to make a 
speech, after the order of his predecessors.&nbsp; But all he 
said was, &ldquo;With the help of God I will hold the balance 
level.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was received with the greatest 
enthusiasm, for it evidently pleased the people more than if he 
had addressed them for an hour.&nbsp; His attention was soon 
directed towards the poverty-stricken and helpless people all 
around him.&nbsp; He caused special enquiries to be made; then he
began to distribute his gifts of charity to all who he believed 
were really in need; and in three days he had given away one 
thousand pounds of his first year&rsquo;s salary.&nbsp; He had 
not been long in the Soudan before he realized the tremendous 
responsibilities he had assumed; and with all his strength of 
character, and his trust in his Almighty, ever-present Friend, it
is not to be wondered at that when alone in the trackless desert,
with the results of ages of wrong-doing before him, this man of 
heroic action and indomitable spirit sometimes gave way to <!-- 
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>depression and murmuring; although this was exceedingly 
rare.&nbsp; If we remember what he had already done and suffered 
for down-trodden humanity.&nbsp; And that now he was doing heroic
work for the true hero&rsquo;s wages&mdash;the love of Christ, 
and the good of his fellow-men.&nbsp; He was labouring not for 
himself, but as the hand of God in providence, in the faith that 
his work was of God&rsquo;s own appointing.&nbsp; The wonder is 
that in the face of perils so dangerous, work so difficult, and 
sufferings so intense, that his spirit was not completely crushed
and broken.&nbsp; We must bear in mind, his work there was to 
secure peace to a country that appeared to be bent on war; to 
suppress slavery amongst a people to whom it was a second nature,
and to whom the trade in human flesh was life, and honour, and 
fortune.&nbsp; To make and discipline an army out of the rawest 
recruits ever put in the field, to develop and grow a flourishing
trade, and to obtain a fair revenue, amid the wildest anarchy in 
the world; the immensity of the undertaking, the infinity of 
detail involved in a single step toward this end, the countless 
odds to be faced; the many pests, the deadly climate, the nightly
and daily alternations of overpowering heat, and of bitter cold, 
to be endured and overcome; the environment of bestial savagery, 
and ruthless fanaticism;&mdash;all these contributed to make the 
achievement unique in human history.&nbsp; <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>He was face 
to face with evil in its worst form, and saw it in all its 
appalling effects upon the nation and its people.&nbsp; He seemed
to have everything against him, and to be utterly alone.&nbsp; 
There stood in front of him the grim ruined land.&nbsp; He faced 
it, however, as a saint and soldier should do; he stood for 
right, truth, and for God.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He would dare to do right.&nbsp; Dare to be
true<br />
He had a work that no other could do;<br />
He would do it so wisely, so bravely, so well,<br />
That angels might hasten the story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some time he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How the Khedive is towards me I don&rsquo;t
know, but thank God he prevents me caring for any one&rsquo;s 
favour or disfavour.&nbsp; I honestly say I do not know anyone 
who would endure the exile and worries of my position out 
here.&nbsp; Some might fear if they were dismissed, that the 
world would talk.&nbsp; Thank God! I am screened from that 
fear.&nbsp; I know that I have done my best, as far as my 
intellect would allow me, for the Khedive, and have tried to be 
just to all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>On contemplating retirement, he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now imagine what I lose by coming back, if 
God so wills it; a life in a tent, with a cold humid air at 
night, to which if, from the heat of the tent you expose 
yourself, you will suffer for it, either in liver or 
elsewhere.&nbsp; The most ordinary fare.&nbsp; <i>Most</i> 
ordinary I can assure you; no vegetables, dry biscuits, a few 
bits of broiled meat, and some dry macaroni, boiled in water and 
sugar.&nbsp; I forgot some soup; up at dawn and to bed between 
eight and nine p.m.&nbsp; No books but one, and that not often 
read for long, for I cannot sit down for a study of those 
mysteries.&nbsp; All day long, worrying about writing orders, to 
be obeyed by others in the degree as they are near or distant 
from me: obliged to think of the veriest trifle, even to the 
knocking off the white ants from the stores, etc.&mdash;that is 
one&rsquo;s life; and, speaking materially, for what gain?&nbsp; 
At the end of two years, say &pound;2,000.&nbsp; At the end of 
three say &pound;3,500 at the outside.&nbsp; The gain to be 
called &lsquo;His Excellency,&rsquo; and this money.&nbsp; Yet 
his poor &lsquo;Excellency&rsquo; has to slave more than any 
individual; to pull ropes, to mend this; make a cover to that 
(just finished a capital cover to the duck Gun).&nbsp; I often 
say, &lsquo;drop the excellency, and do this 
instead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This country would soon cure a man of his 
ambition, I think, and make him content with his lot.&nbsp; The 
intense heat, and other stagnation except you have some 
disagreeable incident, would tame the most enthusiastic; a thin, 
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
85</span>miserable tent under which you sit, with the 
perspiration pouring off you.&nbsp; A month of this life, and you
would be dissatisfied with your lot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gordon had kept up some very interesting correspondence with 
an old friend in China; an old officer in Gordon&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Ever victorious Army,&rdquo; Li Hung Chang.&nbsp; While 
Gordon is feeling unwell, and disposed to send his resignation to
the Khedive&mdash;he writes in his journal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">July 21st, 1879.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall (D.V.) leave for Cairo in ten days, and I hope 
to see you soon; but I may have to go to Johannis before I go to 
Cairo.&nbsp; I am a wreck, like the portion of the 
&lsquo;Victory&rsquo; towed into Gibraltar after Trafalgar; but 
God has enabled me, or rather has used me, to do what I wished to
do&mdash;that is, break down the slave trade.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those 
that honour me I will honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; May I be ground to 
dust, if He will glorify Himself in me; but give me a humble 
heart, for then he dwells there in comfort.&nbsp; I wrote you a 
letter about my illness and tore it up.&nbsp; Thank God, I am 
pretty well now, but I have passed the grave once lately, and 
never thought to see Khartoum.&nbsp; The new Khedive is more 
civil, but I no longer distress myself with such things.&nbsp; 
God is the sole ruler, and I try to walk sincerely before 
Him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
86</span>The letter from Li Hung Chang was to him a source of 
great satisfaction and pleasure, as it showed his example had 
affected for good this eastern ambassador, who visited this 
country only a very few years ago.</p>
<p>The letter ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Tientsin</span>,<br />
<i>March 22nd</i>, <i>1879</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To His Excellency Colonel C. G. Gordon,<br />
Khartoum, Egypt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sir.&mdash;I am instructed by his Excellency the 
Grand Secretary, Li, to answer your esteemed favour, dated the 
27th October, 1878, from Khartoum, which was duly received.&nbsp;
I am right glad to hear from you.&nbsp; It is now fourteen years 
since we parted from each other.&nbsp; Although I have not 
written to you, I often speak of you, and remember you with very 
great interest.&nbsp; The benefit you have conferred on China 
does not appear with your person, but is felt throughout the 
regions in which you played so important and active a part.&nbsp;
All those people bless you for the blessings of peace and 
prosperity which they now enjoy.</p>
<p>Your achievements in Egypt are well known throughout the 
civilized world.&nbsp; I see often in the papers of your noble 
works on the Upper Nile.&nbsp; You are a man of ample <!-- page 
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>resources, with which you suit yourself to any 
emergency.&nbsp; My hope is that you may long be spared to 
improve the conditions of the people amongst whom your lot is 
cast.&nbsp; I am striving hard to advance my people to a higher 
state of development, and to unite both this and all other 
nations within the &lsquo;Four seas&rsquo; under one common 
brotherhood.</p>
<p>I wish you all manner of happiness and prosperity.&nbsp; With 
my highest regards,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain,<br />
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">Li Hung Chang</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all, and through all these various trying vicissitudes he 
remained true to his innate religious convictions, and looked 
upon it all as the filling in of a plan, which was divine.&nbsp; 
His hours for prayer were maintained with as great a regularity 
as were those of another eastern official servant, Daniel, who 
&ldquo;three times a day kneeled on his knees and prayed and gave
thanks to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gordon, when at prayer, placed 
outside his tent a white handkerchief, this was the sign the 
Governor was at his devotions, and no servant or messenger must 
disturb him.&nbsp; He kept closely in touch with God, so to 
speak.&nbsp; His outer life might be ruffled by storms and 
tempests, but within he had the perfect peace.</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>While Gordon was hoping to get away from the trying 
climate and yet more trying circumstances around him, a message 
(not unexpected) reached him, giving him instructions to proceed 
to Abyssinia, and see if he could settle the dispute or 
misunderstanding that had arisen between Johannis the King and 
the Khedive.&nbsp; He proceeded on that very risky mission as he 
states in his letters; the journey was &ldquo;indescribable in 
its solitary grandeur.&nbsp; These interminable deserts, and arid
mountain passes fill the heart with far different thoughts than 
civilized lands do.&rdquo;&nbsp; With few attendants, he 
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;We are still slowly crawling over the 
world&rsquo;s crust.&nbsp; Reaching the dominions of the King of 
Abyssinia, we camped near Ras Alonla, and the priests used to 
gather at 3 a.m. in knots of two and three and chant for an hour 
in a wild melodious manner the Psalms of David.&nbsp; Awakened at
this unearthly hour no one could help being impressed.&nbsp; Some
of them had children who chanted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he 
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;We have just passed a famous convent.&nbsp; 
The great high priest, who only comes out to meet the King, and 
who is supposed to be the King&rsquo;s <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>right hand in
religious questions, came out to meet us.&nbsp; I had some 
splendid silk brocade, which I gave him.&nbsp; He held a gold 
cross in his hand, and spoke of the love of Christ.&nbsp; He 
seemed to be a deeply religious man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Soho says of Abyssinia:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No country in the world is so full of 
churches, monasteries, and ecclesiastics, as Abyssinia.&nbsp; It 
is hardly possible to sing in one church, or monastery, without 
being heard in another, and perhaps by several.&nbsp; They sing 
the Psalms of David, of which they have a very exact translation 
in their own language.&nbsp; They begin their concert by stamping
their feet on the ground, and playing gently on their 
instruments; but when have become warm by degrees, they leave off
drumming, and fall to leaping, dancing, shouting and clapping 
hands, till their is neither tune nor pause, but rather a 
religious riot.&nbsp; For this manner of religious worship, they 
quote the Psalm&mdash;&ldquo;O clap your hands, all ye 
nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gordon says, &ldquo;I could not but like 
this poor simple-minded peasantry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are about a days march from the river 
Taczzi, which joins the Nile at Berber.&nbsp; Nearing the Palace,
if so I may call it, I was met by the King&rsquo;s body 
guard.&nbsp; I was of course wearing the Crest and Field 
Marshal&rsquo;s uniform; the soldiers were sitting on their heels
and never <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>got up.&nbsp; Passing through them I 
found my mule so tired that I got down and walked.&nbsp; On 
arrival at the Palace, I was admitted to the King, who sat upon a
raised d&auml;is, with the Itag&egrave;, or Chief Priest on the 
ground at his left hand.&nbsp; Then guns were fired, and the King
said, &ldquo;That is in your honour, and you can retire,&rdquo; 
which I did, to see him again shortly.&nbsp; Again Gordon visited
the Royal personage, and was granted permission to present his 
case, but Gordon considered himself unduly humbled as he was 
ordered to stand afar off; a stool at length was placed for him 
to sit upon.&nbsp; This humble position Gordon would at other 
times have accepted and tolerated, but not here and now; he must 
show his dignity as the representative of a Foreign, powerful 
monarch; he seized the stool and carried it up to near where the 
King sat, and placed it by his side, saying, &ldquo;Though in 
your hands I may be a prisoner, I am a man as much as you are, 
and can only meet you as an equal.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
sable Majesty was greatly annoyed at Gordon&rsquo;s audacious 
conduct, and remarking said, &ldquo;Gordon Pasha don&rsquo;t you 
know I am the King, and could kill you if I wished.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I am perfectly aware of that,&rdquo; said Gordon, 
&ldquo;Do so at once if it is your Royal pleasure, I am 
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the King, 
&ldquo;Ready to be killed?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; 
said Gordon, &ldquo;I am always ready to die, and so far from 
fearing you putting me to death, you would confer a favour on me 
by so doing, for you would be doing for me that which I am 
precluded by my religious convictions from doing for 
myself.&nbsp; You would relieve me from all the troubles the 
future may have in store for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then my 
power has <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>no terror for you, 
Gordon!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; So Gordon proved more than a match for this 
half-civilized Abyssinian King.&nbsp; His visit, however, could 
not be considered successful as his Majesty was unreasonable in 
all his demands, and so put out of the power of Gordon to reach 
any settlement.&nbsp; So he left the King without effecting what 
he came to do.&nbsp; How to get away now was to him a source of 
anxiety.&nbsp; As he surmised, they were not likely to allow him 
to carry back the valuables he had in his possession.&nbsp; It 
required all his tact and wit and discretion in this perilous 
position.&nbsp; He, however, at the cost of about &pound;1,400 in
bribes and gifts, managed to get away.&nbsp; Then he had to find 
his way back alone.&nbsp; This was a severe ordeal.&nbsp; Over 
mountains covered with snow, and through defiles of rocky places,
now meeting with wild hordes of the dog-faced baboons, then with 
the uncivilized tribes of the human species none the less 
dangerous.&nbsp; He, however, by the care of an ever watchful 
Providence, had escaped serious harm and reached Khartoum in 
safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gordon had felt for some time uneasy in his position, as the 
under officials looked upon him as a religious fanatic, and too 
strict to govern; they tried to annoy him, and they succeeded: so
he sent in his resignation to the Khedive, and as soon as he 
could conveniently, he turned his face homeward.</p>
<p>First of course he visited the Khedive, and he received from 
him a princely welcome, being addressed by him in these words: 
&ldquo;I am glad to see you Gordon Pasha again amongst us, and 
have great pleasure in once more personally acknowledging the 
loyalty with which you always served my country, and my 
government.&nbsp; I should very much like you to remain in my 
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
93</span>service, but if you must retire from us, as you say you 
must, then I am reluctantly compelled to accept your 
resignation.&nbsp; I regret, my dear Gordon, to lose so valued a 
counsellor and friend, and the hearty co-operation of so useful a
servant: and in parting from you, I desire to express my sincere 
thanks to you; assuring you that my remembrance of you and of 
your services to this country will never be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gordon was greatly in need of the rest he now seemed to have 
secured by his resignation.&nbsp; His over sensitive nature could
not have borne up much longer; a frame of iron must have gone 
under in such circumstances; for on his own individual shoulders 
he carried each man&rsquo;s burden, causing him days of anxiety 
and nights of unrest.&nbsp; At Alexandria he was examined by Dr. 
MacKie the surgeon to the British Consulate, who certified that 
he was &ldquo;suffering from symptoms of nervous 
exhaustion.&nbsp; I have recommended him (the Dr. adds) to retire
for several months for complete rest, and quiet&mdash;and that he
may be able to enjoy fresh and wholesome food, as I consider much
of this illness is the result of continued bodily fatigue, 
anxiety and <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>indigestible food.&nbsp; I have 
strongly insisted on his abstaining from all exciting 
work&mdash;especially such as implies business or political 
excitement.&rdquo;&nbsp; Splendid advice, but would Gordon follow
it?&nbsp; Could his active life be suppressed even for so short a
time?&nbsp; None find it harder to rest than those who need it 
most.&nbsp; Gordon had often thought of what pleasure in rest he 
would find when his retirement was an accomplished fact.&nbsp; He
would lie in bed until dinner.&nbsp; He would take short walks 
after dinner.&nbsp; He would undertake no long journeys, either 
driving or by railway.&nbsp; He would not be tempted to go to 
dinner parties.&nbsp; He would really have a quiet time; it was, 
however, only for a short period.</p>
<p>The private secretaryship to Lord Ripon was vacant, and it was
offered to Gordon; he accepted it, but on landing at Bombay he 
found the position would not be to his liking.&nbsp; He says of 
Lord Ripon, &ldquo;we parted perfect friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; After 
Gordon left Egypt someone there wrote to our press saying, 
&ldquo;The name of Gordon whenever and wherever mentioned sends a
thrill of admiration and love throughout the vast Soudan 
territory.&nbsp; For a hand so strong, yet <!-- page 95--><a 
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>withal so 
beneficent, has never before ruled the peoples of this unhappy 
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gordon left the Soudan peaceful, prosperous
and happy, comparatively.&nbsp; After his resignation of the 
position of private secretary to Lord Ripon, he was invited to 
visit China again by Mr. Hart, Chinese Commissioner of Customs at
Pekin, who said to Gordon, &ldquo;I am directed to invite you 
here (that is to say China).&nbsp; Please come and see for 
yourself.&nbsp; This opportunity for doing really useful work on 
a large scale ought not to be lost: work, position, conditions 
can all be arranged with yourself here to your 
satisfaction.&nbsp; Do take six months leave and 
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was characteristic of Gordon that he 
replied as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Inform Hart, Gordon will leave 
for Shanghai first opportunity; as for the conditions, Gordon is 
indifferent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He applied to our Government for leave of absence on the 
grounds that he was invited to go to China.&nbsp; They asked him 
to state more particularly what for, and what position he was 
intending to fill.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am ignorant&rdquo; was his 
reply.&nbsp; This was not considered satisfactory and leave was 
refused.&nbsp; He, <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>however, sent his resignation to the 
War Office, and proceeded to China.&nbsp; Reaching the flowery 
land, once more he proceeded from Shanghai to Tientsin and there 
he had an interview with his old friend and companion in arms, Li
Hung Chang.&nbsp; From him he learned the condition in which 
national and political matters stood.&nbsp; His stay in China was
not very prolonged, but his influence was felt in the Councils of
the Empire; and when he left he knew that peace prevailed, and 
that the war between Russia and China had been averted.&nbsp; In 
the meantime things in the Soudan began to give trouble, the 
cloud on the horizon gathered in blackness.&nbsp; Almost 
immediately Gordon left the Soudan the Turkish Pashas began their
plundering, robbing and ill-treating the poor Soudanese so much 
that we cannot wonder at the rising of the natives in favour of 
the Madhi, for the latter was promising them deliverance from 
this cruel oppression.&nbsp; The rule of the Pashas and 
Bashi-Ba-Zoucks, the Duke of Argyle declared to be &ldquo;cruel, 
intolerant, and unbearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Stewart, in his report, stated that &ldquo;he believed
not one half of the taxes wrung from <!-- page 97--><a 
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>these poor 
people ever found their money go into the treasury of the 
Khedive.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were taxed and levied so unjustly and 
unmercifully that whole districts were reduced to absolute 
destitution.&nbsp; The general rising of the natives against this
dire oppression, threw them into the arms of the Madhi.&nbsp; He 
very soon had a most powerful following, and he quickly mobilized
an army that in 1882 was believed to number not less than 200,000
fighting men.&nbsp; In July of that year this boastful usurper 
pushed his forces into conflict with the Egyptians, when the 
latter were worsted with terrible loss.&nbsp; About 6,000 of 
their bravest men were either killed in battle or left wounded on
the field and the remainder were routed.&nbsp; Shortly after 
another great battle followed.&nbsp; This also went in favour of 
the usurper, and a loss of 10,000 men inflicted.&nbsp; One 
engagement followed another and all went to show that the Madhi 
had won the sympathy and support of the masses of the people, and
it appeared likely he would soon have undisputed sway over the 
entire Soudan.&nbsp; Still another effort was to be made to hurl 
back this powerful and persistent foe.&nbsp; Hicks Pasha, <!-- 
page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>&ldquo;a brave leader,&rdquo; &ldquo;a noble 
general,&rdquo; with an army of 10,000 men, with 6,000 camels, a 
large number of pack horses and mules, was sent to arrest the 
advance of this desperate foe.&nbsp; For some time no news 
reached us, as he was shut out from all means of communication 
with the outer world.&nbsp; At length the appalling news came, 
not only of his defeat, but of his utter destruction.&nbsp; One 
man only was known to have escaped to tell the tale.&nbsp; He 
states, &ldquo;We were led by a treacherous guide into a mountain
pass or defile, and there shut in by rocks; we were confronted 
and surrounded by probably 100,000 of the enemy.&nbsp; For three 
days and nights the battle raged; the few British officers fought
like lions against these overwhelming odds, until, so completely 
cut up by sword, bullet and spear, that he feared he was the only
man who managed to escape.&rdquo;&nbsp; This large army was 
literally annihilated&mdash;1,200 officers perished in this one 
battle.&nbsp; The Madhi took 17,000 Remington rifles, 7 Krupp 
guns, 6 Nordenfelts, 29 brass mounted cannon, and a very large 
amount of ammunition.&nbsp; So that he appeared to be master of 
the situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;What next for the Soudan?&rdquo; was 
being <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>everywhere asked in Egypt and in the 
Soudan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that Gordon was here,&rdquo; was the cry 
of many of the poor down-trodden Soudanese.&nbsp; They believed 
him to be the only man who could bring peace to their desolate 
and unhappy country.</p>
<p>Gordon was at that time taking a quiet rest near Jaffa, in the
Holy Land, and making investigations into places specially spoken
of in the Scriptures.&nbsp; He thought he could locate the place 
where Samuel took Agag and hewed him to pieces.&nbsp; Also the 
well, called &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; and other places 
of interest.&nbsp; It is said at this juncture, things in the 
Soudan had become hopeless.&nbsp; A gentleman sent to one of the 
papers at Cairo the following message: &ldquo;Would to God that 
an angel would stand at the elbow of Lord Granville in London, 
and say, And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Gordon, and 
he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strange
to say, about this time, Gordon was sent for to London, where he 
had interviews with Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for War, 
Lord Granville, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lord Northbrook, 
First Lord of <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the Admiralty, and Sir Charles 
Dilke, President of the Local Government Board, at the War 
Office, and in a very short space of time, the question, which 
was destined to have far reaching results, was settled, and 
Gordon declared his willingness to go to Khartoum at the earliest
possible date.&nbsp; Indeed he said, &ldquo;At once,&rdquo; and 
to go alone.</p>
<p>Something like the following conversation is said to have 
taken place between Gordon and one of his very intimate friends: 
&ldquo;Well, General, have you got your kit ready?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
His reply was, &ldquo;I have got what I always have: this hat is 
good enough, so are these clothes, my boots I think are strong 
enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And how are you off for 
cash?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! I was nearly forgetting that.&nbsp;
I had to borrow &pound;25 from the King of the Belgians to bring 
me home from Palestine; this I must repay, and I shall of course 
need a little more for common daily use.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How 
much do you think, two or three thousand pounds?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh dear no!&nbsp; One hundred pounds apiece for myself and
Stewart, will be enough; what on earth should we want so much 
money for.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the gallant general, with his 
faithful <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>companion&mdash;the late lamented 
Colonel Stewart, started.</p>
<p>We are told they were accompanied to Charing Cross railway 
station by H. R. H. the Duke of Cambridge, who took their tickets
for them; also by Lord Wolseley (who would insist on carrying 
Gordon&rsquo;s portmanteau), Colonel Brackenbury, and Lord 
Hartington&rsquo;s private secretary, who bade them good-bye, and
God speed on their mission, from which they were never to 
return.&nbsp; We think history will never record a more heroic 
example of patriotism, than that of this God-fearing officer, 
riding forth upon his swift footed camel, with only one English 
friend and companion, the Colonel Stewart, and a few Arab 
attendants, to confront and settle the wild and barbarous hordes 
of the Madhi.</p>
<p>One of our papers published the following appropriate 
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not with an army at command,<br />
Not fenced about with guns and swords,<br />
But trusting to their single hands,<br />
Amid a host of savage hordes,<br />
The hero Gordon wends in haste,<br />
Across the desert&rsquo;s arid waste,<br />
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>Beset with perils lies his way,<br />
Yet fear he knows not: Nelson like,<br />
His life would be an easy prey,<br />
If but the Arab dare to strike.<br />
But over him there hangs a spell,<br />
The Soudan people know full well:<br />
Oft he had taught the Eastern mind<br />
The grace of noble-hearted deeds;<br />
Oft cast abuses to the wind,<br />
And succoured men in direst needs;<br />
Nor shall the charm that all allow<br />
Is grandly his, forsake him now:<br />
Oh! should the power of his name<br />
Bend the false prophet to its thrall<br />
And make him deem the hero came,<br />
To pay him just a friendly call,<br />
The ruthless carnage soon might cease,<br />
And Egypt be again at peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The subject of Gordon&rsquo;s mission came up several times in
the British House of Commons as might be expected.&nbsp; Sir 
Stafford Northcote on one occasion said&mdash;&ldquo;There is one
point upon which all our minds are fixed&mdash;I mean the mission
of General Gordon.&nbsp; On that point I was anxious to say 
little or nothing.&nbsp; General Gordon is now engaged in an 
attempt of the most gallant and dangerous kind.&nbsp; No one can 
speak with too much admiration of his courage and self-devotion: 
no one can fail, in <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>this country to sympathise with him,
and earnestly desire his safety and success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching Cairo, Gordon received his plans and instructions 
from the Khedive, and here we think arose some of the 
complications and misunderstandings as to his actual 
position.&nbsp; Was he in the employ of the Khedive, or was he 
still responsible to the Home Government?&nbsp; The Khedive 
expressed himself to Gordon in a letter dated Jan. 26, 1884.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency,&mdash;You are aware that the object of your
arrival here, and of your mission to the Soudan is to carry into 
execution the evacuation of those territories, and to withdraw 
our troops, civil officials, and such of the inhabitants, 
together with their belongings, as may wish to leave for 
Egypt.&nbsp; We trust that your Excellency will adopt the most 
effective measures for the accomplishment of your mission in this
respect, and that, after completing the evacuation, you will take
the necessary steps for establishing an organized Government in 
the different provinces of the Soudan, for the maintenance of 
order, and the cessation of disasters, and incitement to 
revolt.&nbsp; We have full confidence <!-- page 104--><a 
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>in your 
tried abilities and tact, and are convinced that you will 
accomplish your mission according to your desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was hardly in harmony with a telegram from Lord Granville
who said that &ldquo;<i>undertaking military expeditions was 
beyond the scope of the Commission he held</i>, <i>and at 
variance with the pacific policy which was the purpose of his 
mission to the Soudan</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Between the 
Khedive&rsquo;s instructions and commission to Gordon, and his 
holding commission as an officer of the Crown, Gordon was in a 
very difficult position, and those who have blamed Mr. Gladstone,
for what they may have been pleased to call &ldquo;desertion of 
Gordon,&rdquo; should acquaint themselves with all the 
circumstances of the case before doing so, and when all is known,
such blame will be withheld.</p>
<p>Gordon, without lingering in Cairo, hastened to cross the 
desert and get to Khartoum as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Thus our
hero went forth with a gallantry never surpassed, if ever 
equalled.&nbsp; He rode his camel across that land of storm and 
drought, trusting only in Him, who had so often &ldquo;covered 
his defenceless head, beneath the shadow of His wing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not all who seem to fail have failed 
indeed,<br />
Not all who fail have therefore worked in vain;<br />
There is no failure for the good and wise;<br />
What though the seed should fall by the way-side,<br />
And the birds snatch it; yet the birds are fed,<br />
Or they may bear it far across the tide<br />
To give rich harvests after thou art dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p>Sir E. Baring wired to Lord Granville, &ldquo;The interview 
between Gordon and the Khedive was very 
satisfactory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again&mdash;&ldquo;Gordon leaves Cairo
in good spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arrival at Khartoum, it is stated, was marked by wonderful
demonstrations of welcome by the people; thousands of them 
pressing towards him to kiss his feet: calling him the 
&ldquo;Sultan of the Soudan.&rdquo;&nbsp; His first speech was 
received with the wildest enthusiasm.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I 
come not with soldiers but with God on my <!-- page 106--><a 
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>side, to 
redress the wrongs of the Soudan.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day after he 
held a levee at the palace, when vast multitudes thronged around 
him, kissing the ground on which he walked, calling him 
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sultan,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Saviour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He appreciated highly their apparent
loyalty and devotion, and he had offices opened at once where 
everyone who had a grievance might bring it, have it heard and 
judged.</p>
<p>The Government books recording the outstanding debts of the 
over-taxed people, <i>were publicly burned in the presence of 
thousands of onlookers; the kourbasher</i>, <i>whips</i>, <i>and 
implements of torture were thrown down upon the blazing pile</i>:
thus the evidence of debts, and the emblems of oppression 
perished together in the presence of an almost frenzied 
people!&nbsp; Next Gordon visited the prisons; there he found 
dreadful dens of misery; over two hundred poor starving emaciated
beings were confined therein; some bound with chains: some mere 
boys, some old men and women.&nbsp; Many of them were there 
simply on suspicion, and had never had a hearing.&nbsp; The cases
were quickly and carefully enquired into, and before sunset that 
day, most <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>of the unhappy wretches had their 
chains struck off and their freedom given them.</p>
<p>For many days, the markets and shops, and bazaars were finely 
illuminated; and the rejoicing for Gordon&rsquo;s presence and 
deeds was general and universal.&nbsp; Alas, however, the cloud 
which had so long hung over the Soudan began to thicken.&nbsp; 
The Madhi was not to be cheated of what he thought his rightful 
authority and dominion.&nbsp; The following letter recorded in 
Gordon&rsquo;s journal was received by him from the 
Madhi:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the name of God the merciful and 
compassionate;<br />
Praise be to God, the bountiful ruler, and blessing<br />
on our Lord Mahomet and peace.&nbsp; From the servant who<br />
trusts in God&mdash;Mahomet, the son of Abdallah.</p>
<p>To Gordon Pasha of Khartoum,&mdash;May God guide him into the 
path of virtue, Amen!&nbsp; Know that your small steamer, named 
&lsquo;Abbas&rsquo; which you sent with the intention of 
forwarding your news to Cairo, by the way of Dongola, the persons
sent being your representative, Stewart Pasha, and the two 
Consuls, French and English, with other persons, has been 
captured by <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>the will of God.&nbsp; Those who 
believed in us as the Madhi and surrendered, have been delivered;
and those who did not have been destroyed.&nbsp; As your 
representative afore-named, with the Consuls and the 
rest&mdash;whose souls God has condemned to the fire and to 
eternal misery: That steamer and all that was in it have fallen a
prey to the Moslems, and we have taken knowledge of all the 
letters and telegrams which were in it, in Arabic and in Frankish
(languages) and of the maps, which were opened to us (translated)
by those on whom God has bestowed his gifts, and has enlightened 
their hearts with faith, and the benefits of willing 
submission.&nbsp; Also we have found therein the letters sent 
from you to the Mudir of Dongola, with the letters, &amp;c., 
accompanying to be forwarded to Egypt and to European 
countries.&nbsp; All have been seized, and the contents are 
known.&nbsp; It should all have been returned to you, not being 
wanted here; but as it was originally sent from you, and is known
to you, we prefer to send you part of the contents, and mention 
the property therein, so that you may be certified: and in order 
that the truth may make a lasting impression on <!-- page 
109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>my
mind&mdash;in the hope that God may guide thee to the faith of 
Islam, and to surrender to him and to us, that so you and they 
may obtain everlasting good and happiness.&nbsp; Now, first among
the documents seized is the cipher dated September 22, 1884, 
&lsquo;to the Mudir of Dongola.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; On the back of
which is your telegram to the Khedive of Egypt . . .&nbsp; We 
have also taken knowledge of your journal (daily record) of the 
provision in the granary . . .&nbsp; Also your letters written in
European all about the size of Khartoum; and all about the 
arranging of the steamers, with the number of troops in them and 
their arms, and the cannon, and about the movements of the 
troops, and the defeat of your people, and your request for 
reinforcements, even if only a single regiment, and all about how
your agent Cuzzi turned Moslem.&nbsp; Also many letters which had
come to you from your lieutenants and what they contained of 
advice, also stating the number of Europeans at Khartoum . . . 
.&nbsp; Also the diary (registry) of the arms, ammunition, guns 
and soldiers . . . .&nbsp; We have also noted the telegrams of 
the officials and of the <!-- page 110--><a 
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>presidents 
of Courts, and of the Kadi and the Muftis, and Ulema, numbering 
34, sent to the Mohurd&acirc;r of the Khedive in Egypt, dated 
Aug. 28th, 1884, in which they ask for succour from the Egyptian 
Government . . .&nbsp; Also your cipher telegrams to the 
Mohurd&acirc;r of the Khedive in which you explain that on your 
arrival at Khartoum the impossibility had become clear to you of 
withdrawing the troops and the employ&eacute;s, and sending them 
to Egypt, on account of the rebellions in the country, and on the
closing of the roads; for which reason you ask for reinforcements
which did not come . . .&nbsp; Also about your coming to Khartoum
with seven men after the annihilation of Hicks&rsquo; army; and 
your requesting a telegram to be sent to you in Arabic, in plain 
language, about the Soudan to show to the people of 
Khartoum&mdash;as the telegrams in European cipher do not explain
enough . . .&nbsp; Also your letter to the Khedive of Egypt, 
without date, in which you ask to have English soldiers sent . . 
.&nbsp; And your letter to the President of the Council and the 
English Minister at Cairo, in which you speak of your appointing 
three steamers to go and <!-- page 111--><a 
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>inquire as 
to the state of Sennaar, and that you will send soldiers to 
Berber by the steamers to recapture it, sending with them Stewart
and the Consuls, whom the Most High God has destroyed.&nbsp; Also
we have seen the two seals engraved with our name to imitate our 
seals . . . .&nbsp; Tricks in making ciphers, and using so many 
languages, are of no avail.&nbsp; From the Most High God, to whom
be praise, no secrets can be hidden.&nbsp; As to your expecting 
reinforcements, reliance for succour on others than God, that 
will bring you nothing but destruction, and cause you to fall 
into utmost danger in this world and the next.&nbsp; For God Most
High has dispersed sedition through our manifestation, and has 
vanquished the wicked and obstinate people, and has guided those 
who have understanding in the way of righteousness.&nbsp; And 
there is no refuge but in God, and in obedience to His command, 
and that of His prophet and of His Madhi.&nbsp; No doubt you have
heard what has happened to your brethren from whom you expected 
help, at Suakin and elsewhere, whom God has destroyed, and 
dispersed and abandoned.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all this, as we 
have <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>arrived at a days journey from 
Omdurman and are coming please God, to your place, if you return 
to the most High God and become a Moslem and surrender to His 
Order and that of His prophet, and believe in us as the Madhi, 
send us a message from thee, and from those with thee, after 
laying down your arms and giving up the thought of fighting, so 
that I may send you one with safe conduct, by which you will 
obtain assurance of benefits of the blessings of this world and 
the next.&nbsp; Otherwise, and if you do not act thus, you will 
have to encounter war from God and His prophet.&nbsp; And know 
that the Most High God is mighty for thy destruction, as He has 
destroyed others before thee, who were much stronger than thee, 
and more numerous.&nbsp; And you, and your children and your 
property, will be for a prey to the monsters, and you will repent
when repentance will not avail . . .&nbsp; And there is no 
succourer or strength but in God, and peace be upon those who 
have followed the Madhi.&nbsp; (<i>Guidance</i>.)</p>

<p>Gordon&rsquo;s reply was just what we should expect from an 
officer of his temperament and experience.&nbsp; It is true 
things looked anything but cheering and our hero needed all his 
force of character and confidence in the God of Israel.&nbsp; 
This he had and kept brightly burning.&nbsp; To the Madhi he 
replied&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sheikh Mahomed Achmed has sent us a letter 
to inform us that Lupton Bey, Mudir of &lsquo;Bahr Gazelle&rsquo;
has <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>surrendered to him, and that the 
small steamer in which was Stewart Pasha, has been captured by 
him, together with what was therein.&nbsp; But to me it is all 
one whether Lupton Bey has surrendered or has not 
surrendered.&nbsp; And whether he has captured twenty thousand 
steamers like the &lsquo;Abbas&rsquo; or twenty thousand officers
like Stuart Pasha or not; it is all one to me.&nbsp; I am here 
like iron, and hope to see the newly arrived English; and if 
Mahomed Achmed says that the English die, it is all the same to 
me.&nbsp; And you must take a copy of this and give it to the 
messenger from Slatin, and send him out early in the morning, 
that he may go to him.&nbsp; It is impossible for me to have any 
more words with Mahomed Achmed, only lead; and if Mahomed Achmed 
is willing to fight he had better, instead of going to Omdurman, 
go to the white hill by the moat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gordon, though borne up by a sense of the Divine presence, yet
he occasionally at least, felt as if he was leading a forlorn 
hope.&nbsp; We know not, nor can we ever know all the deeds of 
heroism he did for that down trodden people.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A life long year unsuccoured and alone<br 
/>
He stemmed the fury of fanatic strife,<br />
Till all lands claimed the hero as their own,<br />
And wondering would he there lay down his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>It is a mystery, and one that will never be solved, how
he supported his vast family in Khartoum; for food had to be 
distributed to each individual member for months.&nbsp; It is 
also a sad but remarkable fact, that through the last ten months 
he had to depend upon the most unreliable and worthless of 
troops.&nbsp; And for four of those weary months, he had been 
without the cheering presence of his companion in arms, Colonel 
Stewart.&nbsp; Yet he held out bravely, courageously, and in hope
of English help.&nbsp; At this juncture a poetess 
wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A message from one who went in haste<br />
Came flashing across the sea,<br />
It told not of weakness, but trust in God,<br />
When it asked us&mdash;pray for me.<br />
And since from Churches, and English homes,<br />
In the day or the twilight dim,<br />
A chorus of prayers went up to God&mdash;<br />
Bless and take care of him:<br />
A lonely man to those strange far lands,<br />
He has gone with a word of peace;<br />
And a million hearts are questioning<br />
With a pain that cannot cease:<br />
Is Gordon safe?&nbsp; Is there news of him?<br />
What will the tidings be?<br />
<!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Yet utterly safe is he.<br />
Was he not safe when the Chinese shots,<br />
Were flying about his head,<br />
When trouble thickened with every day,<br />
And he was sore bestead;<br />
Was he not safe in his dreary rides,<br />
Over the desert sands;<br />
Safe with the Abyssinian King;<br />
Safe with the robber bands;<br />
We know not the dangers around him now,<br />
But this we surely know&mdash;<br />
He has with him in his hour of need,<br />
His Protector of long ago;<br />
He is not alone, but a Friend is by<br />
Who answers to every need;<br />
God is his refuge and strength at hand,<br />
Gordon is safe indeed:<br />
Safe in living, in dying safe, where is the need of pain;<br />
We may pray&mdash;God give the hero long life,<br />

<p>The last Arab messenger that came from Khartoum before it 
fell, said, &ldquo;Gordon goes every morning at sunrise to the 
top of his Palace wall, and with his large field glass, sweeps 
the horizon as far as possible, and notes as clearly as may be 
the position of the Madhi&rsquo;s forces, which now surrounded 
the City.&nbsp; As night falls, he visits the men at their 
various stations, to give them advice, or encouragement, as the 
case might be deemed necessary.&nbsp; In the daytime he studies 
his maps and reads his Bible, and a work on &ldquo;Holy 
living,&rdquo; by Thomas &agrave; Kempis, and preserves such a 
faith in God as inspired all around him with a courage akin to 
his own.</p>

<p>A letter from Kitchener reached Gordon, which raised his hopes
and considerably brightened his prospects for the time 
being.&nbsp; It ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear General Gordon.&mdash;Mr. Edgerton has
asked me to send you the following:&mdash;&lsquo;August 
30th.&nbsp; Tell Gordon steamers are being passed over the Second
Cataracts, and that we wish to be informed through Dongola 
exactly when he expects to be in difficulties as to provision and
ammunition.&rsquo;&nbsp; Message ends&mdash;&ldquo;Lord Wolseley 
is coming out to command; the 35th regiment is now being sent 
from Halfa to Dongola.&nbsp; Sir E. Wood is at Halfa, General 
Earle, Dormer, Buller, and Freemantle are coming up the Nile with
troops.&nbsp; I think an expedition will be sent across from here
to Khartoum, while another goes with steamers to Berber.&nbsp; A 
few words about what you wish to be done would be 
acceptable.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>In Gordon&rsquo;s journal he says:&mdash;&ldquo;My view is 
this as to the operations of British forces.&nbsp; I will put 
three steamers each with two guns on them, and an armed force of 
infantry at <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the disposal of any British 
authority; will send these steamers to either Methemma opposite 
Shendy, or to the cataract below Berber to meet there any British
force which may come across country to the Nile. . . .&nbsp; I 
cannot too much impress upon you that this expedition will not 
encounter any enemy worth the name in a European sense of the 
word; the struggle is with the climate and destitution of the 
country.&nbsp; It is one of time and patience, and of small 
parties of determined men backed by native allies, which are to 
be got by policy and money. . . .&nbsp; It is the country of the 
irregular, not of the regular.&nbsp; If you move in mass you will
find no end of difficulties; whereas if you let detached parties 
dash out here and there, you will spread dismay in the Arab 
camps.&nbsp; The time to attack is the dawn, or rather before it,
but sixty men would put the Arabs to flight just before dawn, 
while one thousand would not accomplish in daylight.&nbsp; The 
reason is that the strength of the Arabs is in their horsemen, 
who do not dare to act in the dark.&nbsp; I do hope that you will
not drag on the artillery, it will only cause delay and do no 
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>To his sister he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>November 5th</i>, 
<i>1884</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your kind letter, August 7th, came yesterday.&nbsp; We 
have the Madhi close to us, but the Arabs are very quiet. . . . 
.&nbsp; Terrible news&mdash;I hear the steamer I sent down with 
Stewart, Power, and Herbin (French Consul) has been captured and 
all are killed.&nbsp; I cannot understand it&mdash;whether an act
of treachery by someone, or struck on a rock, it is to me 
unaccountable, for she was well armed and had a gun with her; if 
she is lost, so is the journal of events from Jan. 3rd, 1884, to 
Sept. 10th, 1884.&nbsp; A huge volume illustrated and full of 
interest.&nbsp; I have put my steamers at Metemma to wait for the
troops.&nbsp; I am very well but very gray, with the continual 
strain upon my nerves.&nbsp; I have been putting the 
Sheikh-el-Islam and Cadi in prison; they were suspected of

very grieved for the relatives of Stewart, Power, and

<p>Again he writes:&mdash;</p>

121</span>Meanwhile, Gordon is thus hemmed in.&nbsp; General 
Wolseley and his noble band are on their way to his relief.&nbsp;
Many and peculiar are the difficulties of both climate, country, 
and foes; yet they face them like brave, true Englishmen.&nbsp; 
The journey from Cairo to Ambukol, a distance of more than one 
thousand miles, had been traversed without serious 
opposition.&nbsp; From here, however, as they near Khartoum, now 
about two hundred and fifty miles, taking the nearest desert 
route.&nbsp; Lord Wolseley seems here to halt and hesitate, 
whether it is best to go by the Nile, which, as shown on a map, 
takes a bend, forming the shape of a letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; 
nearly; or whether to take the shortest cut and risk the 
opposition that may be expected.&nbsp; He eventually decides that
the Camel Corps and a portion of the Infantry shall take the 
short cut; the desert route to Metemmeh: the rest to go by the 
Nile.&nbsp; It is evidently Wolseley&rsquo;s wish to punish the 
tribes who murdered Stewart, and his companions; so he orders the
South Staffordshire, 38th, and the Royal Sussex, 35th, and the 
Black Watch, 42nd, to advance to Abu Hamed, which lies at the 
northern bend of the &lsquo;S,&rsquo; <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>which the 
Nile makes between Dongola and Metemmeh.</p>
<p>The Camel Corps are ordered to make a dash across the desert 
to the same place.&nbsp; Little did our force dream of the 
difficulties, dangers and deaths that lay before them as they 
entered upon that desert march.&nbsp; We only indicate some of 
them.&nbsp; On their march we are told that having nearly reached
Abu Klea &ldquo;we were turning into our zareba, when it was 
noticed that a group of some two hundred Arabs were on the hills,
not far from us.&nbsp; Two shells were sent amongst them, which 
caused them to retire, but we soon found their sharpshooters had 
crept to within 1,200 yards of our right flank.&nbsp; Also they 
began to drop bullets into our midst, which were annoying and 
destructive.&nbsp; Half a company of Mounted Infantry were told 
off to drive them away.&nbsp; All officers were to see that the 
men were at their posts, with bayonets fixed, ready to jump to 
their feet at the very first alarm.&nbsp; With their overcoats on
and their blankets wrapped around them, men lay down on that 
memorable night.&nbsp; All lights put out, all talking and 
smoking strictly prohibited.&nbsp; A deadly stillness, <!-- page 
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
123</span>disturbed only by the whizzing or thud of the shot from
the enemy&rsquo;s guns.&nbsp; Colonel Burnaby, who had managed 
somehow to find a place in the Expedition, expressed his great 
delight in having arrived in time to engage in what he now saw to
be the prospect of a terrible struggle.</p>
<p>He stated, &ldquo;that he had arrived at that time of life 
when the two things that interested him most were war and 
politics; and was just as happy in the desert fighting the Arabs,
as he was at home slating an unworthy politician.&nbsp; Here, 
however, he was, and must face the conflict.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
January, 16th, 1885.&nbsp; About 10 p.m.&nbsp; The sentries came 
rushing into the lines.&nbsp; The officers called out, 
&ldquo;stand to your arms men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The alarm, however, 
was false&mdash;only a feint on the part of the enemy.&nbsp; 
Still (says the writer), they kept harassing us by a continual 
dropping of shot from their long rangers.&nbsp; About 7.30 a.m., 
General Stewart prepared to send out an attacking column, with 
the object of driving them from the wells, which were now only 
four or five miles distant.&nbsp; The troops marched 
out&mdash;Mounted Infantry, Royal Artillery with three guns, 
Guards (this was the Front Face); Right Face&mdash;Guards, Royal 
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
124</span>Sussex; Left Face&mdash;Mounted Infantry, Heavy Cavalry
Regiment.&nbsp; The 19th Hussars, under Colonel Barrow, numbering
90 sabres, were sent to left flank to advance along the spur of 
land on the north of the wady.&nbsp; Their duty was to move 
forward on a line paralleled with the Square, and prevent the 
enemy on our left from gaining the high ground across the little 
wady.&nbsp; A squadron of the 19th, thirty sabres strong, 
followed the Square, marching by the front right to assist the 
skirmishers.&nbsp; The Heavies were in charge of Colonel Talbot; 
the Guards by Colonel Boscowen; the Mounted Infantry by Major 
Barrow; the Naval Brigade by Lord Charles Beresford; the Royal 
Sussex by Major Sunderland; the Royal Artillery by Captain 
Norton; and the Royal Engineers by Major Dorwood.&nbsp; So they 
marched slowly forward.&nbsp; The progress was like that of some 
ponderous machine, slow, regular, compact, despite the hail of 
bullets that came from front, left and right, and ultimately from
the rear.&nbsp; Some ten or twelve thousand Arabs it was seen had
surrounded the Zareba.&nbsp; There was no retreat; it was 
&ldquo;do or die!&rdquo;&nbsp; About 9.50 a.m., about 5000 of the
enemy were seen on the <!-- page 125--><a 
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>opposite 
side of the square, 400 or 500 yards distant, and seemed as if 
they would make a dash for our square.&nbsp; Dervishes on 
horseback, and some on foot, marshalled them, standing a few 
paces in front of the frantic host.&nbsp; With banners 
fluttering, tom-toms clamouring, and shouts of Allah, they began 
to move towards our square.&nbsp; The skirmisher&rsquo;s fire 
seemed to have no effect; though a few of them fell, they 
ultimately made a run towards us like the roll of a black 
surf.&nbsp; Lord Charles Beresford&rsquo;s superintendence was 
moved to the left face, rear corner, to be brought into action; 
for here they seemed to press the attack.&nbsp; Unhappily, before
many rounds had been fired, the cartridges stuck and the weapon 
was useless.&nbsp; Still down came the Arab wave.&nbsp; One 
terrible rush of swordsmen and spearmen&mdash;scarcely any 
carrying guns&mdash;their rifle fire had practically 
ceased.&nbsp; In wild excitement, their white teeth glistening 
and the sheen of their brandished weapons flashing like thousands
of mirrors; onward they came against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer says:&mdash;&ldquo;A volley of shot was sent into 
them at 150 yards; at least one hundred <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Arabs fell,
and their force wavered, as a man stops to get his breath; but 
the forces behind them came leaping over their falling brethren, 
and came charging straight into our ranks.&nbsp; I was at that 
instant inside the square, when I noticed our men shuffling 
backwards.&nbsp; Some say Colonel Burnaby issued an order for the
men to fall back, but I did not hear it.&nbsp; Burnaby rode out 
apparently to assist our skirmishers, who were running in, hard 
pressed: all but one succeeding in getting inside the square: 
Burnaby went, sword in hand, on his borrowed nag, for his own had
been shot under him that morning&mdash;he put himself in the way 
of a Sheik who was charging down on horseback.&nbsp; Ere the Arab
closed with him a bullet from some in our ranks brought the Sheik
headlong to the ground.&nbsp; The enemy&rsquo;s spearmen were 
close behind, and one of them clashed at Colonel Burnaby, 
pointing the long blade of his spear at his throat.&nbsp; Burnaby
leant forward in his saddle and parried the Moslem&rsquo;s 
thrusts; but the length of the weapon (8 feet or more) made it 
difficult to deal a blow as desired.&nbsp; Once or twice the 
Colonel managed to touch him.&nbsp; This only made him <!-- page 
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
127</span>the more alert.&nbsp; Burnaby fenced smartly, just as 
if he was playing in an assault-at-arms, and there was a smile on
his features as he drove off the man&rsquo;s awkward 
points.&nbsp; With that lightning instinct which I have seen the 
desert warrior display in battle, whilst coming to 
another&rsquo;s aid, an Arab who had been pursuing a soldier, 
passed five paces to Burnaby&rsquo;s right and rear, and, turning
with a sudden spring, this second Arab ran his spear point into 
the Colonel&rsquo;s right shoulder!&nbsp; It was but a slight 
wound, enough though to cause Burnaby to twist round in his 
saddle to defend himself from this unexpected attack.&nbsp; One 
of our soldiers saw the situation, and ran and drove his sword 
bayonet through this second assailant.&nbsp; As the soldier 
withdrew his steel the ferocious Arab wriggled round and tried to
reach him.&nbsp; This he could not do, for he reeled and fell 
over.&nbsp; Brief as was Burnaby&rsquo;s glance at this second 
assailant, it was long enough for the first Arab to deliver his 
spear-point thrust full in the brave officer&rsquo;s 
throat.&nbsp; The blow brought Burnaby out of his saddle; but it 
required some seconds before he let go of the bridle-reins, and 
tumbled <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>upon the ground.&nbsp; Half-a-dozen 
Arabs were now about him.&nbsp; With the blood gushing in streams
from his gashed throat the dauntless Burnaby leaped to his feet, 
sword in hand, and slashed at the ferocious group.&nbsp; They 
were the wild shrieks of a proud man dying hard, and he was 
quickly overborne, and left helpless and dying!&nbsp; The heroic 
soldier who sprang to his rescue, was, I fear, also slain in the 
mele&eacute;, for though I watched for him, I never saw him get 
back to his place in the 
ranks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the square had been broken.&nbsp; The Arabs were driving 
their spears at our men&rsquo;s breasts.&nbsp; Happily, however, 
the enemy&rsquo;s ranks had been badly decimated by our bullets; 
yet they fought desperately, until bullet or bayonet stopped 
their career.&nbsp; Then from another quarter came a great onrush
with spears poised and swords uplifted straight into our rear 
corner, the Arab horse struck like a tempest.&nbsp; The Heavies 
were thrown into confusion, for the enemy were right among them, 
killing and wounding with demoniacal fury.&nbsp; General Stewart 
himself rode into their midst to assist, but his horse was killed
under him, and he was saved from the Arab spearmen <!-- page 
129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
129</span>with great difficulty: Lord Airlie received two slight 
spear wounds, and so did Lord C. Beresford.&nbsp; The Dervishes 
made terrible havoc for a few minutes.&nbsp; It was an awful 
scene, for many of the wounded and dying perished by the hands of
the merciless Arabs, infuriated by their Sheiks, whose wild 
hoarse cries rent the air, whilst the black spearmen ran hither 
and thither thirsting for blood.&nbsp; Lord St. Vincent had a 
most providential escape.&nbsp; So great was the peril that the 
officers in the Guards and Mounted Infantry placed their men back
to back to make one last effort to save the situation.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; says the writer, who was outside on the 
right face: &ldquo;they appeared to spin round a large mound like
a whirlpool of human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the enemy showed signs of wavering, for the fire of our 
English lads was fierce and withering.&nbsp; A young officer 
rallied a number of men on the rear; and these delivered a most 
telling fire into the enemy&rsquo;s ranks; the strained tension 
of the situation had been most severe, when at last the Arabs, 
two or three at first, then twenties and fifties, trotted off the
field and in a very few minutes there was not an enemy to <!-- 
page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
130</span>be seen.&nbsp; With cheer upon cheer, shouting until we
were hoarse, we celebrated this dearly won victory.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thus ended one of several terrible conflicts the men of 
the Expedition had to go through on their way to the beleaguered 
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; These lines of poetry, were written shortly 
after the news of this fierce engagement reached 
England:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They were gathered on the desert,<br />
Like pebbles on the shore,<br />
And they rushed upon the Christian<br />

Came down the dusky swarm.<br />

Was sounding through the air,<br />
As the foe sprang from his ambush,<br />
Like the tiger from his lair.<br />
They knew the distant flashing<br />

And they would not know defeat.<br />
And swifter, ever swifter<br />
Swept on the savage horde,<br />
And from the serried British ranks<br />
A murderous fire was poured;<br />
And like the leaves in autumn<br />

<p>Mr. Burleigh tells us that &ldquo;History records no military 
events of a more stirring character, or situation more thrilling 
and dramatic than those through which Sir Herbert Stewart&rsquo;s
flying column passed on this dreadful march.&nbsp; Through those 
terrible struggles with the followers of the Madhi, many a brave 
soldier fell <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>and his body lies in the grave of 
the African desert.&nbsp; It did, however, seem as if through all
the difficulties of the relieving forces, that Lord Wolseley 
would soon give the gallant defender of Khartoum succour and 
relief.&nbsp; The splendid victories won at Abu Klea Wells, and 
other places, and their march to join the Nile forces, clearly 
showed that they were terribly in earnest, and that they had the 
true British sympathetic heart.</p>
<p>Finding some of Gordon&rsquo;s steamers on the Nile, it was 
their first impulse to man them and force their way up to 
Khartoum at once.&nbsp; This was on January 21st, 1885.&nbsp; The
General in Command learned that the steamers needed some repairs,
and he (Sir Charles Wilson) deemed it necessary for the safety of
his troops to make a reconnaissance down the river towards Berber
before starting up to Khartoum.&nbsp; He took the steamers, 
which, though small as the Thames pleasure boats, had been made 
bullet-proof by the ingenuity and industry of the hero in 
distress; and with a small British force and two hundred and 
forty Soudanese (they also had in tow a nugger laden with dhura),
they proceeded <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>towards Berber some distance, and 
then, returning for their important work of relief, they pressed 
on to Khartoum in the face of the greatest dangers from the 
numerous fanatical Arabs, until they could see the city, and 
found to their horror and disappointment that Gordon&rsquo;s flag
was torn down.&nbsp; The city had surrendered to the forces of 
the Madhi, and it could be seen to swarm with his 
followers!&nbsp; Treachery had been at work, as Gordon feared; 
and the brave defender of Khartoum sealed his fidelity with his 
own blood.&nbsp; We never doubted but he would &ldquo;die at his 
post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone was on a visit to Holker Hall 
to see the Duke of Devonshire, when the sad tale was told of 
Gordon&rsquo;s betrayal and death.&nbsp; To add to the grief, the
Queen, whose inmost soul had been stirred by the terrible news, 
sent to Mr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington a telegram couched in 
terms of anger and of blame, and this, not in cypher as was her 
wont, but plain and open.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone addressed to Her Majesty by return, in the most 
courteous manner possible, what may be considered a vindication 
of his <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>actions in the matter and also that 
of his Cabinet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;To the 
Queen,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gladstone has had the honour this day to receive 
your Majesty&rsquo;s telegram, <i>en clair</i>, relating to the 
deplorable intelligence received this day from Lord Wolseley, and
stating that it is too fearful to consider that the fall of 
Khartoum might have been prevented and many precious lives saved 
by earlier action.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone does not presume to 
estimate the means of judgment possessed by your Majesty, but so 
far as his information and recollection at the moment go, he is 
not altogether able to follow the conclusion which your Majesty 
has been pleased thus to announce.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone is under 
the impression that Lord Wolseley&rsquo;s force might have been 
sufficiently advanced to save Khartoum, had not a large portion 
of it been detached by a circuitous route along the river, upon 
the express application of General Gordon, to occupy Berber on 
the way to the final destination.&nbsp; He speaks, however, with 
submission on a point of this kind.&nbsp; There is, indeed, in 
some quarters, a belief that the river <!-- page 136--><a 
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>route ought
to have been chosen at an earlier period, and had the navigation 
of the Nile, in its upper region, been as well known as that of 
the Thames, this might have been a just ground of reproach.&nbsp;
But when, on the first symptoms that the position of General 
Gordon in Khartoum was not secure, your Majesty&rsquo;s advisers 
at once sought from the most competent persons the best 
information they could obtain respecting the Nile route, the 
balance of testimony and authority was decidedly against it, and 
the idea of the Suakin and Berber route, with all its formidable 
difficulties, was entertained in preference; nor was it till a 
much later period that the weight of opinion and information 
warranted the definite choice of the Nile route.&nbsp; Your 
Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers were well aware that climate and 
distance were far more formidable than the sword of the enemy, 
and they deemed it right, while providing adequate military 
means, never to lose from view what might have proved to be the 
destruction of the gallant army in the Soudan.&nbsp; It is 
probable that abundant wrath and indignation will on this 
occasion be poured <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>out upon them.&nbsp; Nor will they 
complain if so it should be; but a partial consolation may be 
found on reflecting that neither aggressive policy, nor military 
disaster, nor any gross error in the application of means to 
ends, has marked this series of difficult proceedings, which, 
indeed, have greatly redounded to the honour of your 
Majesty&rsquo;s forces of all ranks and arms.&nbsp; In these 
remarks, which Mr. Gladstone submits with his humble devotion, he
has taken it for granted that Khartoum has fallen through the 
exhaustion of its means of defence.&nbsp; But your Majesty may 
observe from the telegram that this is uncertain.&nbsp; Both the 
correspondent&rsquo;s account and that of Major Wortley refer to 
the delivery of the town by treachery, a contingency which on 
some previous occasions General Gordon has treated as far from 
improbable; and which, if the notice existed, was likely to 
operate quite independently of the particular time at which a 
relieving force might arrive.&nbsp; The presence of the enemy in 
force would naturally suggest the occasion or perhaps even the 
apprehension of the approach of the British army.&nbsp; In 
pointing to these considerations, Mr. Gladstone is far <!-- page 
138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
138</span>from assuming that they are conclusive upon the whole 
case; in dealing with which the government has hardly ever at any
of its stages been furnished sufficiently with those means of 
judgment which rational men usually require.&nbsp; It may be 
that, on a retrospect, many errors will appear to have been 
committed.&nbsp; There are many reproaches, from the most 
opposite quarters, to which it might be difficult to supply a 
conclusive answer.&nbsp; Among them, and perhaps amongst the most
difficult, as far as Mr. Gladstone can judge, would be the 
reproach of those who might argue that our proper business was 
the protection of Egypt, that it never was in military danger 
from the Madhi, and that the most prudent course would have been 
to provide it with adequate frontier defences, and to assume no 
responsibility for the lands beyond the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heroes have fought, and warriors bled,<br />
For home, and love, and glory;<br />
Your life and mine will soon be sped,<br />
Then what will be the story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The agonizing suspense in which our nation had been kept for 
weeks, was now at an end, and <!-- page 139--><a 
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>we learned 
the worst.&nbsp; The news fell like a thunderbolt upon our 
country!&nbsp; Within forty-eight hours of the time when Gordon 
would have heard the triumph ranting of English cheers, and once 
more clasped the faithful hands of British brother soldiers; 
treachery had done its worst.&nbsp; Thus ended this unique 
life&rsquo;s drama of one of the noblest hearts that ever beat in
soldier&rsquo;s bosom, and one of the truest to his Queen, to his
country, and to his God.&nbsp; The heart that had caused him to 
share his home with the homeless, and his bread with the hungry, 
that had led him to kneel in prayer by the dying; the heart that 
had so often throbbed for the misery of slavery, and the slave 
trade, as to risk his life as of no value to stop that cursed 
practice and traffic; that heart was pierced by the treacherous 
hands (in all probability) of the very man Gordon had made the 
greatest sacrifice to save.&nbsp; Such terrible news threw our 
land into universal mourning, and thousands wept for the hero 
that would never return.</p>
<p>The military correspondent of the &ldquo;Daily News&rdquo; at 
Dongola, writes: &ldquo;Two men arrived <!-- page 140--><a 
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>here 
yesterday, April 11th, 1885, whose story throws some light on the
capture of Khartoum.&nbsp; They were soldiers in Gordon&rsquo;s 
army, taken at the time and sold as slaves, but who ultimately 
escaped.&nbsp; Their names are Said Abdullah and Jacoob 
Mahomet.&nbsp; I will let them tell their own 
history.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;After stating they were first taken 
at Omdurman, subsequently to the capture of Khartoum; were then 
stolen by arabs and sold to two Kabbabish merchants, and 
afterwards escaped from Aboudom to Debbah, from which place they 
had reached Dongola; they went on to relate the doings of Farig 
Pasha previously to the taking of Khartoum.&nbsp; I have given 
you some account of the story by telegraph, and it has been 
partly made familiar substantially through other channels.&nbsp; 
They continued: &ldquo;That night Khartoum was delivered into the
hands of the rebels.&nbsp; It fell through the treachery of the 
accursed Farig Pasha, the Circassian, who opened the gate.&nbsp; 
May he never reach Paradise!&nbsp; May Shaytan take possession of
his soul!&nbsp; But it was Kismet.&nbsp; The gate was called 
Bouri&rsquo;; it was on the Blue Nile.&nbsp; We were on guard 
near, but did not see what was going on.&nbsp; We were <!-- page 
141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
141</span>attacked and fought desperately at the gate.&nbsp; 
Twelve of our staff were killed, and twenty-two of us retreated 
to a high room, where we were taken prisoners, and now came the 
ending.&nbsp; The red Flag with the crescent was destined no more
to wave over the Palace; nor would the strains of the hymns of 
His Excellency be heard any more at eventide in Khartoum.&nbsp; 
Blood was to flow in her streets, in her dwellings, in her very 
mosque, and on the Kenniseh of the Narsira.&nbsp; A cry arose, 
&ldquo;To the Palace! to the Palace!&rdquo;&nbsp; A wild and 
furious band rushed towards it, but they were resisted by the 
black troops, who fought desperately.&nbsp; They knew there was 
no mercy for them, and that even were their lives spared, they 
would be enslaved, and the state of the slave, the perpetual 
bondage with hard taskmasters, is worse than death.&nbsp; Slaves 
are not treated well, as you think; heavy chains are round their 
ankles and middle, and they are lashed for the least offence 
until blood flows.&nbsp; We had fought for the Christian Pasha 
and for the Turks, and we knew that we should receive no 
mercy.&nbsp; The house was set on fire: the fight raged and the 
slaughter continued till the <!-- page 142--><a 
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>streets 
were slippery with blood.&nbsp; The rebels rushed onward to the 
Palace.&nbsp; We saw a mass rolling to and fro, but did not see 
Gordon Pasha killed.&nbsp; He met his fate, we believe, as he was
leaving the Palace, near the large tree which stands on the 
esplanade.&nbsp; The Palace is not a stone&rsquo;s throw, or at 
any rate a gun shot distance from the Austrian Consul&rsquo;s 
house.&nbsp; He was going in that direction, to the magazine on 
the Kenniseh, a long way off.&nbsp; We did not hear what became 
of his body, nor did we hear that his head was cut off; but we 
saw the head of the traitor Farig Pasha, who met with his 
deserts.&nbsp; We have heard it was the blacks that ran away; and
that the Egyptian soldiers fought well; that is not true, they 
were craven.&nbsp; Had it not been for them, in spite of the 
treachery of many within the town, the Arabs would not have got 
in, for we watched the traitors.&nbsp; And now fearful scenes 
took place in every house and building, in the large Market 
Place, in the small bazaars; men were slain crying for mercy, but
mercy was not in the hearts of those savage enemies.&nbsp; Women 
and children were robbed of their jewels of silver, of their 
bracelets, necklaces of precious <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>stones, and
carried off to be sold to the Bishareen merchants as 
slaves.&nbsp; Yes, and white women too, mother and daughter alike
were carried off from their homes of comfort.&nbsp; Wives and 
children of Egyptian merchants, formerly rich, owning ships and 
mills; these were sold afterwards, some for 340 thaleries or 
more, some for 25, according to age and good looks.&nbsp; And the
poor black women already slaves, and their children, 70 or 80 
thaleries.&nbsp; Their husbands and masters were slain before 
their eyes . . . . this fighting and spilling of blood continued 
till noon, till the sun rode high in the sky.&nbsp; There was 
riot, wrangling, hubbub and cursing, till the hour of evening 
prayer.&nbsp; But the Muezzin was not called, neither were any 
prayers offered up at the Moslem Mosque on that dark day in the 
annals of Khartoum.&nbsp; Meanwhile the screeching devils 
bespattered with gore, swarming about in droves and bands, found 
very little plunder, so were disappointed, and sought out Farig 
Pasha, and found him with the Dervishes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is 
the hidden treasure?&rsquo; they at once demanded of him.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We know that you are acquainted with the hiding 
place.&nbsp; Where is the <!-- page 144--><a 
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>money and 
riches of the city and its merchants?&nbsp; We know that those 
who left Khartoum did not take away their valuables, and you know
where it is hid.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Dervishes seeing the tumult 
questioned him sharply, and addressed him thus: &ldquo;The long 
expected one our Lord, desires to know where the English Pasha 
hid his wealth.&nbsp; We know he was very rich, and every day 
paid large sums of money; that has not been concealed from our 
Lord.&nbsp; Now therefore let us know that we may bear him word 
where all the money is hidden.&nbsp; Let him be bound in the 
inner chamber and examined; and the gates closed against the 
Arabs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Farig was then questioned, but he 
&ldquo;swore by Allah and by the souls of his fathers back to 
three generations, that Gordon had no money, and that he knew of 
no hidden treasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You lie (cried the 
Dervishes); you wish after a while to come and dig it out 
yourself.&nbsp; Listen to what we are going to say to you.&nbsp; 
We are sure you know where the money is hidden.&nbsp; We are not 
careful of your life, for you have betrayed the man whose salt 
you had eaten; you have been the servant of the infidel, and you 
have betrayed even him.&nbsp; <!-- page 145--><a 
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Unless you 
unfold this secret of the buried treasure, you will surely 
die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Farig with proud bearing said, &ldquo;I care 
not for your threats.&nbsp; I have told you the truth, Allah 
knows.&nbsp; There is no money, neither is there treasure.&nbsp; 
You are fools to suppose there is.&nbsp; I have done a great 
deed, I have delivered to your lord and master (the Madhi), the 
city which you never could have taken without my help.&nbsp; I 
tell you again there is no treasure, and you will rue the day if 
you kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the Dervishes then stepped forward and struck him, 
bound as he was, in the mouth; then another rushed at him with 
his two-edged sword, struck him behind the neck so that with this
one blow his head fell from his shoulders; (so perished the arch 
traitor); may his soul be afflicted!&nbsp; But as for Gordon 
Pasha the magnanimous, may his soul have peace!&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
story of these men may, or may not be true, but it seems on the 
face of it trustworthy.</p>
<p>It is, however, out of harmony with the description given of 
Gordon&rsquo;s death by Slatin Pasha, who was taken a prisoner at
the time of the fall of Khartoum, and had been kept for <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
146</span>eleven years in captivity, but eventually made his 
escape.&nbsp; He was in attendance at the International 
Geographical Congress held at the Imperial Institute, and devoted
to African affairs, when he told the story of his escape from 
Khartoum.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;The City of Khartoum fell on the 
16th Jan., 1885, and Gordon was killed on the highest step of the
staircase of his Palace.&nbsp; His head was cut off and exhibited
to Slatin whilst the latter was in chains, with expressions of 
derision and contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have no doubt now as to the fact that Gordon Pasha, the 
illustrious, the saintly, the brave defender, died doing his 
duty.&nbsp; In all civilized lands there are still men who tell 
of Gordon Pasha&rsquo;s unbounded benevolence; of his mighty 
faith, of his heroism and self-sacrifice, and they mourn with us 
the loss of one of the most saintly souls our world has ever 
known.</p>

laid below,<br />

forwarded to the bereaved and stricken sister of our hero from 
the Khedive of Egypt, written from</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Abdui Palace</span>,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cairo</span>,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Feb.</span> 24, 1885.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altho&rsquo; I do not wish to intrude upon the great 
sorrow which has fallen upon you in the death of your 
distinguished brother, the late General Gordon Pasha, yet as 
Egypt and myself have so much reason to deplore his loss, I 
desire to convey to you my heart-felt sympathy in the terrible 
bereavement it has been God&rsquo;s will you should suffer.&nbsp;
I cannot find words to express to you the respect and admiration 
with which your brother&rsquo;s simple faith and heroic courage 
have inspired me: the whole world resounds with the name of the 
Englishman whose chivalrous nature afforded it for many years its
brightest and most powerful example,&mdash;an example which I 
believe will influence thousands of persons for good through all 
time.&nbsp; To a man of Gordon&rsquo;s character the 
disappointment of hopes he deemed so near fruition, and the 
sudden manner of his death were of little importance.&nbsp; In 
his own words, he left weariness for perfect rest.&nbsp; Our 
mourning for him is true and real; as is also our loss, but we 
have a sure hope that a life and death such as his are not 
extinguished by what <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>we call death.&nbsp; I beg to renew 
to you, Madam, the assurance of my sincere sympathy and 
respectful condolence.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mehemit 
Tewfik</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also from the Queen, a letter full of womanly and queenly 
sympathy is here recorded from <i>The Daily News</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss 
Gordon</span>,&mdash;How shall I write to you, or how shall I 
attempt to express what I feel?&nbsp; To think of your dear, 
noble, heroic brother, who served his country and his Queen so 
truly, so heroically, with a self-sacrifice so edifying to the 
world, not having been rescued: that the promises of support were
not fulfilled&mdash;which I so frequently and constantly pressed 
on those who asked him to go&mdash;is to me grief inexpressible: 
indeed it has made me ill.&nbsp; My heart bleeds for you, his 
sister, who have gone through so many anxieties on his account, 
and who loved the dear brother as he deserved to be.&nbsp; You 
are all so good and trustful, and have such strong faith, that 
you will be sustained even now, when real absolute evidence of 
your brother&rsquo;s death does not exist&mdash;but I fear there 
cannot be much doubt of it.&nbsp; Some day I hope to see you 
again to tell you all I cannot express.&nbsp; My daughter 
Beatrice, who has felt quite as I do, wishes me to express her 
deepest sympathy with you.&nbsp; I hear so many expressions of 
sorrow from abroad; from my eldest daughter The Crown Princess, 
and from my cousin the King of the Belgians&mdash;<!-- page 
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
149</span>the very warmest.&nbsp; Would you express to your other
sister, and your elder brother my true sympathy, and what I do so
keenly feel, the stain left upon England for your dear 
brother&rsquo;s cruel, though heroic fate!&nbsp; Ever, dear Miss 
Gordon, yours sincerely and sympathizingly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">V.R.I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second letter from Her Majesty the Queen to acknowledge Miss
Gordon&rsquo;s gift of her brother&rsquo;s Bible.&nbsp; The very 
Bible he used when with me in Manchester.&nbsp; His companion at 
Gravesend, and during his sojourn in the Soudan (first 
time).&nbsp; &ldquo;It was so worn out (says Miss Gordon) that he
gave it to me.&nbsp; Hearing that the Queen would like to see it,
I forwarded it to Windsor Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this Bible is 
now placed in an enamel and crystal case called &ldquo;The St. 
George&rsquo;s Casket,&rdquo; where it now lies open on a white 
satin cushion, with a marble bust of General Gordon on a pedestal
beside it.</p>
<p>Her Majesty writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Gordon</span>,&mdash;It 
is most kind and good of you to give me this precious Bible, and 
I only hope that you are not depriving yourself and family of 
such a <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span

other.&nbsp; May I ask you, during how many years your dear, 
heroic brother had it with him?&nbsp; I shall have a case made 
for it with an inscription, and place it in the library here, 
with your letter and the touching extract from his last to 
you.&nbsp; I have ordered, as you know, a Marble Bust of your 
Dear Brother to be placed in the corridor here, where so many 
busts and pictures of our greatest Generals, and Statesmen are, 
and hope that you will see it before it is finished, to give your
opinion as to the likeness.&mdash;Believe me always yours very 
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Victoria</span> R.I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A most touching and I think true epitaph has been written in 
Greek and translated by Professor Jebb, of the University of 
Glasgow touching the death of General Gordon:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Leaving a perpetual remembrance, thou art 
gone; in thy death thou wert even such as in thy life; wealth to 
the poor, hope to the desponding, support to the weak.&nbsp; Thou
couldst meet desperate troubles with a spirit that knew not 
despair, and breathe might into the trembling.&nbsp; The Lord of 
China owes thee thanks for thy benefits; the throne of his 
ancient kingdom hath not been cast down.&nbsp; And where the Nile
unites the divided strength of his streams, a city saw thee 
long-suffering.&nbsp; A multitude dwelt therein, but thine alone 
was the valour that guarded it through all that year, when by day
and by night thou didst keep watch <!-- page 151--><a 
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>against the
host of the Arabians, who went around it to devour it, with 
spears thirsting for blood.&nbsp; Thy death was not wrought by 
the God of war, but by the frailties of thy friends.&nbsp; For 
thy country and for all men God blessed the work of thy 
hand.&nbsp; Hail, stainless warrior! hail, thrice victorious 
hero!&nbsp; Thou livest and shalt teach aftertimes to reverence 
the council of the Everlasting Father.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should he have been spared to return to our land&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We had the laurels ready<br />
That patient brow to crown,<br />
But the traitors steel was swift and sharp<br />
To strike our honours down.<br />
God His own victor crowneth,<br />
He counts not gain nor loss,<br />
For the dauntless heart that battles<br />
&rsquo;Neath the shadow of the Cross.<br />
Rest for the gallant soldier,<br />
Where&rsquo;er he lieth low,<br />
His rest is still and deep to-day,<br />
&rsquo;Mid clash of friend and foe.<br />
He stands amid the light he loved,<br />
Whence all the clouds depart,<br />
But there&rsquo;s a gap within our ranks,<br />
And a void within our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great men are usually measured by their character, not by 
their successes; but measured <!-- page 152--><a 
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>by either 
standard Gordon must be considered a <i>great</i> man.&nbsp; In 
him were incarnated all the highest characteristics of the heroes
of our land, and other lands, and of the illustrious servants of 
God in all ages.&nbsp; His life was swayed by a noble purpose, 
and by this he was borne onward and upward in a career of noble 
doing and daring.&nbsp; He had courage of the very highest 
quality, and by this he carved his way into the very front rank 
of our heroes, and won remarkable distinctions in life&rsquo;s 
fiercest battles.&nbsp; His crowning characteristics were, I 
think, his genuineness, and unfailing trust in God.&nbsp; These, 
especially the latter, were the inspiration of his life; and 
these alone offer the truest explanation of his heroic 
deeds.&nbsp; Even in Spain his name had a fragrance that was 
attractive and beautiful.&nbsp; One of the papers <i>The El 
Dia</i>, of Madrid, wrote: &ldquo;Where even the greatest events 
which occur abroad hardly attract the attention of the general 
public, the daring enterprises of General Gordon had excited the 
greatest interest.&nbsp; This was partly because of the immense 
importance of the drama which was being played in the Soudan, and
because of the extraordinary development <!-- page 153--><a 
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>of the 
drama; but it was chiefly due to the sympathy of the people with 
the heroic champion of light and civilization; for his spotless 
honesty; for his valour, tried times without number; for his 
British tenacity; for his faith in his religion and country; for 
his keen insight; for his heroic unselfishness, and for all his 
other fine qualities.&nbsp; Gordon has become recognised in Spain
as an original character, grand and complete, whom future 
generations will idealize, and whom history will call by the name
of genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gordon, the great soldier and loveable Saint is dead; and 
he himself could wish no nobler ending of an unselfish life, 
after such a life of adventure, of heroism, and of humble trust 
in God.</p>
<p>A combination of strange, rare qualities helped to make him 
one of the most remarkable men our country has ever seen.&nbsp; 
As a Christian of rarest purity and consecration, and as a hero 
whose fame has filled two hemispheres, &ldquo;His name shall be 
had in everlasting remembrance.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has added new 
chapters to the glorious stories of British pluck and heroism, 
and has left a name to which our young men will look back <!-- 
page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
154</span>upon with pride; and the best of us will reverence, so 
long as truth, faith, self-devotion, and lofty sense of duty stir
the admiration of men who are worthy to be called his 
fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; Our British nation thrills with a proud 
joy as it reflects upon the splendid achievements of that 
stainless life, now crowned with the laurels of martyrdom, and of
an Empire&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>The memorial in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral most beautifully 
sets forth the leading traits in his character:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Major General Charles George Gordon, C.B., 
who at all times and everywhere, gave his strength to the weak, 
his substance to the poor, his sympathy to the suffering, his 
heart to God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born at Woolwich, 28th Jan., 1838.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slain at Khartoum, 26th Jan., 1885.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saved an Empire by his warlike genius, he ruled vast
provinces with justice, wisdom, power.&nbsp; And lastly, obedient
to his Sovereign&rsquo;s command, he died in the heroic attempt 
to save men, women and children from imminent and deadly 
peril.&nbsp; &lsquo;Greater love hath no man than this, that a 
man lay down his life for his friends.&rsquo;&mdash;St. John, xv.
ch., v. 13.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
